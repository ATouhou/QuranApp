Is someone who shows the way to the Truth more worthy to be followed, or someone who cannot find the way unless he himself is shown? What is the matter with you? How do you judge?&rsquo;", b: "জিজ্ঞেস কর, আছে কি কেউ তোমাদের শরীকদের মধ্যে যে সত্য-সঠিক পথ প্রদর্শন করবে? বল, আল্লাহই সত্য-সঠিক পথ প্রদর্শন করেন, সুতরাং এমন যে লোক সঠিক পথ দেখাবে তার কথা মান্য করা কিংবা যে লোক নিজে নিজে পথ খুঁজে পায় না, তাকে পথ দেখানো কর্তব্য। অতএব, তোমাদের কি হল, কেমন তোমাদের বিচার?"},
