<p class="verse"><a name="24:21" />21: Believers, do not follow in Satan&rsquo;s footsteps- if you do so, he will urge you to indecency and evil. If it were not for God&rsquo;s bounty and mercy towards you, not one of you would ever have attained purity. God purifies whoever He will: God is all hearing, all seeing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:22" />22: Those who have been graced with bounty and plenty should not swear that they will [no longer] give to kinsmen, the poor, those who emigrated in God&rsquo;s way: let them pardon and forgive. Do you not wish that God should forgive you? God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:23" />23: Those who accuse honourable but unwary believing women are rejected by God, in this life and the next. A painful punishment awaits them</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:24" />24: on the Day when their own tongues, hands, and feet will testify against them about what they have done-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:25" />25: on that Day, God will pay them their just due in full- and they will realize that God is the Truth that makes everything clear.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:26" />26: Corrupt women are for corrupt men, and corrupt men are for corrupt women; good women are for good men and good men are for good women. The good are innocent of what has been said against them; they will have forgiveness and a generous provision.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:27" />27: Believers, do not enter other people&rsquo;s houses until you have asked permission to do so and greeted those inside- that is best for you: perhaps you will bear this in mind.</p>
