<p class="verse"><a name="9:118" />118: And to the three men who stayed behind: when the earth, for all its spaciousness, closed in around them, when their very souls closed in around them, when they realized that the only refuge from God was with Him, He turned to them in mercy in order for them to return [to Him]. God is the Ever Relenting, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:119" />119: You who believe, be mindful of God: stand with those who are true.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:120" />120: The people of Medina and their neighbouring desert Arabs should not have held back from following God&rsquo;s Messenger, nor should they have cared about themselves more than him: if ever they suffer any thirst, weariness, or hunger in God&rsquo;s cause, take any step that angers the disbelievers, or cause any harm to an enemy, a good deed is recorded in their favour on account of it- God never wastes the reward of those who do good-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:121" />121: if they spend a little or a lot for God&rsquo;s cause, if they traverse a mountain pass, all this is recorded to their credit so that God can reward them in accordance with the best of their deeds.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:122" />122: Yet it is not right for all the believers to go out [to battle] together: out of each community, a group should go out to gain understanding of the religion, so that they can teach their people when they return and so that they can guard themselves against evil.</p>
