I will certainly wipe out the bad deeds of those who emigrated and were driven out of their homes, who suffered harm for My cause, who fought and were killed.

<p class="verse"><a name="3:197" />197: this is only a brief enjoyment, after which Hell will be their home- a miserable resting place!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:198" />198: But those who were mindful of their Lord will have Gardens graced with flowing streams where they will stay as a reward from God. What God has is best for those who are truly good.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:199" />199: Some of the People of the Book believe in God, in what has been sent down to you and in what was sent down to them: humbling themselves before God, they would never sell God&rsquo;s revelation for a small price. These people will have their rewards with their Lord: God is swift in reckoning.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:200" />200: You who believe, be steadfast, more steadfast than others; be ready; always be mindful of God, so that you may prosper.</p>
