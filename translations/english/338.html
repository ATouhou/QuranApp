<p class="verse"><a name="22:47" />47: They will challenge you [Prophet] to hasten the punishment. God will not fail in His promise- a Day with your Lord is like a thousand years by your reckoning.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="22:48" />48: To many a town steeped in wrongdoing I gave more time and then struck them down: they all return to Me in the end.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="22:49" />49: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;People, I am sent only to give you clear warning.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="22:50" />50: Those who believe and do good deeds will be forgiven and have a generous reward,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="22:51" />51: but those who strive to oppose Our messages and try in vain to defeat Us are destined for the Blaze.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="22:52" />52: We have never sent any messenger or prophet before you [Muhammad] into whose wishes Satan did not insinuate something, but God removes what Satan insinuates and then God affirms His message. God is all knowing and wise:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="22:53" />53: He makes Satan&rsquo;s insinuations a temptation only for the sick at heart and those whose hearts are hardened- the evildoers are profoundly opposed [to the Truth]-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="22:54" />54: and He causes those given knowledge to realize that this Revelation is your Lord&rsquo;s Truth, so that they may believe in it and humble their hearts to Him: God guides the faithful to the straight path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="22:55" />55: The disbelievers will remain in doubt about it until the Hour suddenly overpowers them or until torment descends on them on a Day devoid of all hope.</p>
