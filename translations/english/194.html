<p class="verse"><a name="9:41" />41: So go out, no matter whether you are lightly or heavily armed, and struggle in God&rsquo;s way with your possessions and your persons: this is better for you, if you only knew.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:42" />42: They would certainly have followed you [Prophet] if the benefit was within sight and the journey short, but the distance seemed too great for them. They will swear by God, &lsquo;If we could, we certainly would go out [to battle] with you,&rsquo; but they ruin themselves, for God knows that they are lying.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:43" />43: God forgive you [Prophet]! Why did you give them permission to stay at home before it had become clear to you which of them spoke the truth and which were liars?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:44" />44: Those who have faith in God and the Last Day do not ask you for exemption from struggle with their possessions and their persons- God knows exactly who is mindful of Him-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:45" />45: only those who do not have faith in God and the Last Day ask your permission to stay at home: they have doubt in their hearts and so they waver.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:46" />46: If they had really wanted to go out [to battle] with you, they would have made preparations, but God was loath to let them rise up and made them hold back. It was said, &lsquo;Stay with those who stay behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:47" />47: They would only have given you trouble if they had gone out [to battle] with you: they would have scurried around, trying to sow discord among you, and some of you would willingly have listened to them- God knows exactly who does evil.</p>
