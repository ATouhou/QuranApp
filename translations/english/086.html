<p class="verse"><a name="4:46" />46: Some Jews distort the meaning of [revealed] words: they say, &lsquo;We hear and disobey,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; [adding the insult] &lsquo;May you not hear,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Raina [Look at us],&rsquo; twisting it abusively with their tongues so as to disparage religion. If they had said, &lsquo;We hear and obey,&rsquo; &lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Unzurna [Look at us],&rsquo; that would have been better and more proper for them. But God has spurned them for their defiance; they believe very little.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:47" />47: People of the Book, believe in what We have sent down to confirm what you already have before We wipe out [your sense of ] direction, turning you back, or reject you, as We rejected those who broke the Sabbath: God&rsquo;s will is always done.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:48" />48: God does not forgive the joining of partners with Him: anything less than that He forgives to whoever He will, but anyone who joins partners with God has concocted a tremendous sin.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="4:50" />50: See how they invent lies about God, this in itself is a flagrant sin!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:51" />51: Do you not see how those given a share of the Scripture, [evidently] now believe in idols and evil powers? They say of the disbelievers, &lsquo;They are more rightly guided than the believers.&rsquo;</p>
