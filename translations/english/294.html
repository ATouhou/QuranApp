<p class="verse"><a name="18:5" />5: They have no knowledge about this, nor did their forefathers&ndash;&ndash;it is a monstrous assertion that comes out of their mouths: what they say is nothing but lies.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:6" />6: But [Prophet] are you going to worry yourself to death over them if they do not believe in this message?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:7" />7: We have adorned the earth with attractive things so that We may test people to find out which of them do best,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:8" />8: but We shall reduce all this to barren dust.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:9" />9: [Prophet], do you find the Companions in the Cave and al-Raqim so wondrous, among all Our other signs?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:10" />10: When the young men sought refuge in the cave and said, &lsquo;Our Lord, grant us Your mercy, and find us a good way out of our ordeal,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:11" />11: We sealed their ears [with sleep] in the cave for years.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:12" />12: Then We woke them so that We could make clear which of the two parties was better able to work out how long they had been there.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:13" />13: [Prophet], We shall tell you their story as it really was. They were young men who believed in their Lord, and We gave them more and more guidance.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:14" />14: We gave strength to their hearts when they stood up and said, &lsquo;Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and earth. We shall never call upon any god other than Him, for that would be an outrageous thing to do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:15" />15: These people of ours have taken gods other than Him. Why do they not produce clear evidence about them? Who could be more unjust than someone who makes up lies about God?</p>
