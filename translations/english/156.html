<p class="verse"><a name="7:44" />44: The people of the Garden will cry out to the people of the Fire, &lsquo;We have found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true?&rsquo; and they will answer, &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;. A voice will proclaim from their midst, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s rejection [hangs] over the evildoers:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:45" />45: those who turned others away from God&rsquo;s path and tried to make it crooked, those who denied the Hereafter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:46" />46: A barrier divides the two groups with men on its heights recognizing each group by their marks: they will call out to the people of the Garden, &lsquo;Peace be with you!&rsquo;- they will not have entered, but they will be hoping,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:47" />47: and when their glance falls upon the people of the Fire, they will say, &lsquo;Our Lord, do not let us join the evildoers!&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:48" />48: and the people of the heights will call out to certain men they recognize by their marks, &lsquo;What use were your great numbers and your false pride?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:49" />49: And are these the people you swore God would never bless? [Now these people are being told], &ldquo;Enter the Garden! No fear for you, nor shall you grieve.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:50" />50: The people of the Fire will call to the people of Paradise, &lsquo;Give us some water, or any of the sustenance God has granted you!&rsquo; and they will reply, &lsquo;God has forbidden both to the disbelievers-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:51" />51: those who took their religion for distraction, a mere game, and were deluded by worldly life.&rsquo; Today We shall ignore them, just as they have ignored their meeting with this Day and denied Our Revelations.</p>
