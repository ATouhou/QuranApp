<p class="verse"><a name="59:10" />10: Those who came after them say, &lsquo;Lord, forgive us our sins and the sins of our brothers who believed before us, and leave no malice in our hearts towards those who believe. Lord, You are truly compassionate and merciful.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:11" />11: Have you [Prophet] considered the hypocrites who say to their fellows, the faithless among the People of the Book, &lsquo;If you are driven out, we shall go with you- we would never listen to anyone who sought to harm you- and if you are attacked, we shall certainly come to your aid&rsquo;? God bears witness that they are in fact liars:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:12" />12: if they are driven out, they will never leave with them; if they are attacked, they will never help them. Even if they did come to their aid, they would soon turn tail and flee- in the end they would have no help.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:13" />13: Fear of you [believers] is more intense in their hearts than fear of God because they are people devoid of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:14" />14: Even united they would never fight you, except from within fortified strongholds or behind high walls. There is much hostility between them: you think they are united but their hearts are divided because they are people devoid of reason.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:15" />15: Like those who went just before them, they have tasted the result of their conduct and a painful punishment awaits them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:16" />16: Like Satan, who says to man, &lsquo;Do not believe!&rsquo; but when man disbelieves, says, &lsquo;I disown you; I fear God, the Lord of the Worlds,&rsquo;</p>
