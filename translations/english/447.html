<p class="verse"><a name="37:26" />26: no indeed! They will be in complete submission on that Day&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:27" />27: and they will turn on one another accusingly.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:28" />28: They will say, &lsquo;You came to us from a position of power.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:29" />29: They will say, &lsquo;No! It was you who would not believe-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:30" />30: we had no power over you- and you were already exceeding all limits.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:31" />31: Our Lord&rsquo;s sentence on us is just and we must all taste the punishment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:32" />32: We led you astray as we ourselves were astray.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:33" />33: On that Day they will all share the torment:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:34" />34: this is how We deal with the guilty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:35" />35: Whenever it was said to them, &lsquo;There is no deity but God,&rsquo; they became arrogant,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:36" />36: and said, &lsquo;Are we to forsake our gods for a mad poet?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="37:42" />42: fruits- and will be honoured</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:43" />43: in gardens of delight;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:44" />44: seated on couches, facing one another.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:45" />45: A drink will be passed round among them from a flowing spring:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:46" />46: white, delicious to those who taste it,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:47" />47: causing no headiness or intoxication.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:48" />48: With them will be spouses- modest of gaze and beautiful of eye-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:49" />49: like protected eggs.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:50" />50: They will turn to one another with questions:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:51" />51: one will say, &lsquo;I had a close companion on earth</p>
