<p class="verse"><a name="36:13" />13: Give them the example of the people to whose town messengers came.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:14" />14: We sent two messengers but they rejected both. Then We reinforced them with a third.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:15" />15: They said, &lsquo;Truly, we are messengers to you,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:16" />16: but they answered, &lsquo;You are only men like ourselves. The Lord of Mercy has sent nothing; you are just lying.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:17" />17: Our duty is only to deliver the message to you,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:18" />18: but they answered, &lsquo;We think you are an evil omen. If you do not stop, we shall stone you, and inflict a painful torment on you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:19" />19: The messengers said, &lsquo;The evil omen is within yourselves. Why do you take it as an evil omen when you are reminded of the Truth? You are going too far!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:20" />20: Then, from the furthest part of the city, a man came running. He said, &lsquo;My people, follow the messengers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:21" />21: Follow them: they are not asking you to reward them and they are rightly guided.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:22" />22: Why should I not worship the One who created me? It is to Him that you will be returned.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:23" />23: How could I take besides Him any other gods, whose intercession will not help me and who would not be able to save me if the Lord of Mercy wished to harm me?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:24" />24: Then I would clearly be in the wrong.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:25" />25: I believe in your Lord, so listen to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:26" />26: He was told, &lsquo;Enter the Garden,&rsquo; so he said, &lsquo;If only my people knew</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:27" />27: how my Lord has forgiven me and set me among the highly honoured.&rsquo;</p>
