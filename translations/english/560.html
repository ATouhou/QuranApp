<p class="surah">At-Tahrim</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:1" />1: Prophet, why do you prohibit what God has made lawful to you in your desire to please your wives? Yet God is forgiving and merciful:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:2" />2: He has ordained a way for you [believers] to release you from [such] oaths&ndash;&ndash;God is your helper: He is the All Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:3" />3: The Prophet told something in confidence to one of his wives. When she disclosed it [to another wife] and God made this known to him, he confirmed part of it, keeping the rest to himself. When he confronted her with what she had done, she asked, &lsquo;Who told you about this?&rsquo; and he replied, &lsquo;The All Knowing, the All Aware told me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:4" />4: If both of you [wives] repent to God&ndash;&ndash;for your hearts have deviated&ndash;&ndash;[all will be well]; if you collaborate against him, [be warned that] God will aid him, as will Gabriel and all righteous believers, and the angels too will back him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:5" />5: His Lord may well replace you with better wives if the Prophet decides to divorce any of you: wives who are devoted to God, true believers, devout, who turn to Him in repentance and worship Him, given to fasting, whether previously married or virgins.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:6" />6: Believers, guard yourselves and your families against a Fire fuelled by people and stones, over which stand angels, stern and strong; angels who never disobey God&rsquo;s commands to them, but do as they are ordered:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:7" />7: &lsquo;You who disbelieve, make no excuses today: you are only being repaid for what you used to do.&rsquo;</p>
