<p class="verse"><a name="18:57" />57: Who could be more wrong than the person who is reminded of his Lord&rsquo;s messages and turns his back on them, ignoring what his hands are storing up for him [in the Hereafter]?

<p class="verse"><a name="18:58" />58: Your Lord is the Most Forgiving, and full of mercy: if He took them to task for the wrongs they have done, He would hasten their punishment on. They have an appointed time from which they will have no escape,</p>
