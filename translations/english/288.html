<p class="verse"><a name="17:60" />60: [Prophet], We have told you that your Lord knows all about human beings. The vision We showed you was only a test for people, as was the cursed tree [mentioned] in the Quran. We warn them, but this only increases their insolence.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:61" />61: When We said to the angels, &lsquo;Bow down before Adam,&rsquo; they all bowed down, but not Iblis. He retorted, &lsquo;Why should I bow down to someone You have created out of clay?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:62" />62: and [then] said, &lsquo;You see this being You have honoured above me? If You reprieve me until the Day of Resurrection, I will lead all but a few of his descendants by the nose.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:63" />63: God said, &lsquo;Go away! Hell will be your reward, and the reward of any of them who follow you- an ample reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:64" />64: Rouse whichever of them you can with your voice, muster your cavalry and infantry against them, share their wealth and their children with them, and make promises to them- Satan promises them nothing but delusion-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:65" />65: but you will have no authority over My [true] servants: Your Lord can take care of them well enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:66" />66: [People], it is your Lord who makes ships go smoothly for you on the sea so that you can seek His bounty: He is most merciful towards you.</p>
