<p class="verse"><a name="58:13" />13: Were you afraid to give charity before consulting the Prophet? Since you did not give charity, and God has relented towards you, you should [at least] observe your prayers, pay the prescribed alms, and obey God and His Messenger: God is well aware of your actions.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="58:14" />14: Have you not seen [Prophet] those who give their loyalty to people with whom God is angry? They are neither with you nor with them, and knowingly swear to lies.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="58:19" />19: Satan has gained control over them and made them forget God. They are on Satan&rsquo;s side, and Satan&rsquo;s side will be the losers:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="58:20" />20: those who oppose God and His Messenger will be among the most humiliated.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="58:21" />21: God has written, &lsquo;I shall most certainly win, I and My messengers.&rsquo; God is powerful and almighty.</p>
