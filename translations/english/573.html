<p class="verse"><a name="72:14" />14: Some of us submit to Him and others go the wrong way: those who submit to God have found wise guidance,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:15" />15: but those who go wrong will be fuel for Hellfire.&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:16" />16: If they had taken to the right way, We would have given them abundant water to drink-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:17" />17: a test for them&ndash;&ndash;but anyone who turns away from his Lord&rsquo;s Revelation will be sent by Him to spiralling torment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:18" />18: Places of worship are for God alone- so do not pray to anyone other than God-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:19" />19: yet when God&rsquo;s Servant stood up to pray to Him, they pressed in on him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:20" />20: Say, &lsquo;I pray to my Lord alone; I set up no partner with Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:21" />21: Say, &lsquo;I have no control over any harm or good that may befall you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:22" />22: Say, &lsquo;No one can protect me from God: I have no refuge except in Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:23" />23: I only deliver [what I receive] from God- only His messages.&rsquo; Whoever disobeys God and His Messenger will have Hell&rsquo;s Fire as his permanent home:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:24" />24: when they are confronted by what they have been warned about, they will realize who has the weaker protector and the smaller number.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:25" />25: Say, &lsquo;I do not know whether what you have been warned about is near, or whether a distant time has been appointed for it by my Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:26" />26: He is the One who knows what is hidden.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:27" />27: He does not disclose it except to a messenger of His choosing. He sends watchers to go in front and behind</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:28" />28: to ensure that each of His messengers delivers his Lord&rsquo;s message: He knows all about them, and He takes account of everything.</p>
