<p class="surah">An-Najm</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:1" />1: By the star when it sets!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:2" />2: Your companion has not strayed; he is not deluded;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:3" />3: he does not speak from his own desire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:4" />4: The Quran is nothing less than a revelation that is sent to him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:5" />5: It was taught to him by [an angel] with mighty powers</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:6" />6: and great strength, who stood</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:7" />7: on the highest horizon</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:8" />8: and then approached&ndash;&ndash;coming down</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:9" />9: until he was two bow-lengths away or even closer&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:10" />10: and revealed to God&rsquo;s servant what He revealed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:11" />11: [The Prophet&rsquo;s] own heart did not distort what he saw.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:12" />12: Are you going to dispute with him what he saw with his own eyes?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:13" />13: A second time he saw him:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:14" />14: by the lote tree beyond which none may pass</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:15" />15: near the Garden of Restfulness,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:16" />16: when the tree was covered in nameless [splendour].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:17" />17: His sight never wavered, nor was it too bold,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:18" />18: and he saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:19" />19: [Disbelievers], consider al-Lat and al-Uzza,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:20" />20: and the third one, Manat&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:21" />21: are you to have the male and He the female?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:22" />22: That would be a most unjust distribution!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:23" />23: these are nothing but names you have invented yourselves, you and your forefathers. God has sent no authority for them. These people merely follow guesswork and the whims of their souls, even though guidance has come to them from their Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:24" />24: Is man to have everything he wishes for,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:25" />25: when the present life and the life to come belong only to God?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="53:26" />26: There are many angels in heaven whose intercession will be of no use until God gives permission to those He will, whose words He will accept.</p>
