<p class="verse"><a name="10:7" />7: Those who do not expect to meet Us and are pleased with the life of this world, contenting themselves with it and paying no heed to Our signs,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:8" />8: shall have the Fire for their home because of what they used to do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:9" />9: But as for those who believe and do good deeds, their Lord will guide them because of their faith. Streams will flow at their feet in the Gardens of Bliss.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:10" />10: Their prayer in them will be, &lsquo;Glory be to You, God!&rsquo; their greeting, &lsquo;Peace,&rsquo; and the last part of their prayer, &lsquo;Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:11" />11: If God were to hasten on for people the harm [they have earned] as they wish to hasten on the good, their time would already be up. But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander blindly in their excesses.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:12" />12: When trouble befalls man he cries out to Us, whether lying on his side, sitting, or standing, but as soon as We relieve him of his trouble he goes on his way as if he had never cried out to Us to remove his trouble. In this way the deeds of such heedless people are made attractive to them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:13" />13: Before you people, We destroyed whole generations when they did evil- their messengers brought them clear signs but they refused to believe. This is how We repay the guilty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:14" />14: Later We made you their successors in the land, to see how you would behave.</p>
