<p class="verse"><a name="51:31" />31: Abraham said, &lsquo;What is your errand, messengers?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:32" />32: They said, &lsquo;We are sent to a people lost in sin,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:33" />33: to bring down rocks of clay,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:34" />34: marked by your Lord for those who exceed all bounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:35" />35: We brought out such believers as were there-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:36" />36: We found only one household devoted to God-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:37" />37: and left the town to be a sign for those who fear the painful punishment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:38" />38: There is another sign in Moses: We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:39" />39: Pharaoh turned away with his supporters, saying, &lsquo;This is a sorcerer, or maybe a madman,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:40" />40: so We seized him and his forces and threw them into the sea: he was to blame.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:41" />41: There is another sign in the Ad: We sent the life-destroying wind against them</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:42" />42: and it reduced everything it came up against to shreds.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:43" />43: And also in the Thamud: it was said to them, &lsquo;Make the most of your lives for a while,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:44" />44: but they rebelled against their Lord&rsquo;s command, so the blast took them. They looked on helplessly:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:45" />45: they could not even remain standing, let alone defend themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:46" />46: Before that We destroyed the people of Noah. They were a truly sinful people!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:47" />47: We built the heavens with Our power and made them vast,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:48" />48: We spread out the earth- how well We smoothed it out!-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:49" />49: and We created pairs of all things so that you [people] might take note.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:50" />50: [So, say to them, Prophet], &lsquo;Quickly, turn to God- I am sent by Him to give you clear warning-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="51:51" />51: and do not set up any other god alongside Him. I am sent by Him to give you clear warning!&rsquo;</p>
