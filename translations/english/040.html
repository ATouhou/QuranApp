<p class="verse"><a name="2:246" />246: [Prophet], consider the leaders of the Children of Israel who came after Moses, when they said to one of their prophets, &lsquo;Set up a king for us and we shall fight in God&rsquo;s cause.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;But could it be that you would not fight, if it were ordained for you?&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;How could we not fight in God&rsquo;s cause when we and our children have been driven out of our homeland?&rsquo; Yet when they were commanded to fight, all but a few of them turned away: God has full knowledge of those who do wrong.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:247" />247: Their prophet said to them, &lsquo;God has now appointed Talut to be your king,&rsquo; but they said, &lsquo;How can he be king over us when we have a greater right to rule than he? He does not even have great wealth.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;God has chosen him over you, and has given him great knowledge and stature. God grants His authority to whoever He pleases: God is magnanimous, all knowing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:248" />248: Their prophet said to them, &lsquo;The sign of his authority will be that the Ark [of the Covenant] will come to you. In it there will be [the gift of] tranquillity from your Lord and relics of the followers of Moses and Aaron, carried by the angels. There is a sign in this for you if you believe.&rsquo;</p>
