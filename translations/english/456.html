<p class="verse"><a name="38:44" />44: &lsquo;Take a small bunch of grass in your hand, and strike [her] with that so as not to break your oath.&rsquo; We found him patient in adversity; an excellent servant! He, too, always turned to God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:45" />45: Remember Our servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, all men of strength and vision.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:46" />46: We caused them to be devoted to Us through their sincere remembrance of the Final Home:</p>
