<p class="verse"><a name="3:16" />16: those who say, &ldquo;Our Lord, we believe, so forgive us our sins and protect us from suffering in the Fire,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:17" />17: those who are steadfast, truthful, truly devout, who give [in God&rsquo;s cause] and pray before dawn for forgiveness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:18" />18: God bears witness that there is no god but Him, as do the angels and those who have knowledge. He upholds justice. There is no god but Him, the Almighty, the All Wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:19" />19: True Religion, in God&rsquo;s eyes, is islam: [devotion to Him alone]. Those who were given the Scripture disagreed out of rivalry, only after they had been given knowledge- if anyone denies God&rsquo;s revelations, God is swift to take account-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:20" />20: if they argue with you [Prophet], say, &lsquo;I have devoted myself to God alone and so have my followers.&rsquo; Ask those who were given the Scripture, as well as those without one, &lsquo;Do you too devote yourselves to Him alone?&rsquo; If they do, they will be guided, but if they turn away, your only duty is to convey the message. God is aware of His servants.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:21" />21: Give news of agonizing torment to those who ignore God&rsquo;s revelations, who unjustifiably kill prophets, who kill those who command that justice is done:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:22" />22: the deeds of such people will come to nothing in this world and in the next and no one will help them.</p>
