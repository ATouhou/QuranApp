<p class="verse"><a name="65:1" />1: Prophet, when any of you intend to divorce women, do so at a time when their prescribed waiting period can properly start, and calculate the period carefully: be mindful of God, your Lord. Do not drive them out of their homes&ndash;&ndash;nor should they themselves leave&ndash;&ndash;unless they commit a flagrant indecency. These are the limits set by God&ndash;&ndash; whoever oversteps God&rsquo;s limits wrongs his own soul&ndash;&ndash;for you cannot know what new situation God may perhaps bring about.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="65:2" />2: When they have completed their appointed term, either keep them honourably, or part with them honourably. Call two just witnesses from your people and establish witness for the sake of God. Anyone who believes in God and the Last Day should heed this: God will find a way out for those who are mindful of Him,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="65:3" />3: and will provide for them from an unexpected source; God will be enough for those who put their trust in Him. God achieves His purpose; God has set a due measure for everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="65:4" />4: If you are in doubt, the period of waiting will be three months for those women who have ceased menstruating and for those who have not [yet] menstruated; the waiting period of those who are pregnant will be until they deliver their burden: God makes things easy for those who are mindful of Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="65:5" />5: This is God&rsquo;s command, which He has sent down to you. God will wipe out the sinful deeds and increase the rewards of anyone who is mindful of Him.</p>
