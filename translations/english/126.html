<p class="verse"><a name="5:109" />109: On the Day when God assembles all the messengers and asks, &lsquo;What response did you receive?&rsquo; they will say, &lsquo;We do not have that knowledge: You alone know things that cannot be seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:110" />110: Then God will say, &lsquo;Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour to you and to your mother: how I strengthened you with the holy spirit, so that you spoke to people in your infancy and as a grown man; how I taught you the Scripture and wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel; how, by My leave, you fashioned the shape of a bird out of clay, breathed into it, and it became, by My leave, a bird; how, by My leave, you healed the blind person and the leper; how, by My leave, you brought the dead back to life; how I restrained the Children of Israel from [harming] you when you brought them clear signs, and those of them who disbelieved said, &ldquo;This is clearly nothing but sorcery&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:111" />111: and how I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and My messengers- they said, &ldquo;We believe and bear witness that we devote ourselves [to God].&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:112" />112: When the disciples said, &lsquo;Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down a feast to us from heaven?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Beware of God if you are true believers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:113" />113: They said, &lsquo;We wish to eat from it; to have our hearts reassured; to know that you have told us the truth; and to be witnesses of it.&rsquo;</p>
