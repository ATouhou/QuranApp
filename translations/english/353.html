<p class="verse"><a name="24:29" />29: You will not be blamed for entering houses where no one lives, and which could provide you with some useful service. God knows everything you do openly and everything you conceal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:30" />30: [Prophet], tell believing men to lower their glances and guard their private parts: that is purer for them. God is well aware of everything they do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:31" />31: And tell believing women that they should lower their glances, guard their private parts, and not display their charms beyond what [it is acceptable] to reveal; they should let their headscarves fall to cover their necklines and not reveal their charms except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands&rsquo; fathers, their sons, their husbands&rsquo; sons, their brothers, their brothers&rsquo; sons, their sisters&rsquo; sons, their womenfolk, their slaves, such men as attend them who have no sexual desire, or children who are not yet aware of women&rsquo;s nakedness; they should not stamp their feet so as to draw attention to any hidden charms. Believers, all of you, turn to God so that you may prosper.</p>
