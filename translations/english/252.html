<p class="verse"><a name="13:19" />19: Can someone who knows that the revelation from your Lord is the Truth be equal to someone who is blind? Only those with understanding will take it to heart;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:20" />20: those who fulfil the agreements they make in God&rsquo;s name and do not break their pledges;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:21" />21: who join together what God commands to be joined; who are in awe of their Lord and fear the harshness of the Reckoning;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:22" />22: who remain steadfast through their desire for the face of their Lord; who keep up the prayer; who give secretly and openly from what We have provided for them; who repel evil with good. These will have the reward of the [true] home:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:23" />23: they will enter perpetual Gardens, along with their righteous ancestors, spouses, and descendants; the angels will go in to them from every gate,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:24" />24: &lsquo;Peace be with you, because you have remained steadfast. What an excellent reward is this home of yours!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:25" />25: But there will be rejection for those who break their confirmed agreements made in God&rsquo;s name, who break apart what God has commanded to be joined and who spread corruption on earth: theirs is the dreadful home-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:26" />26: God gives abundantly to whoever He will, and sparingly to whoever He will- and though they may revel in the life of this world, it is but a fleeting comfort compared with the Life to come.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:27" />27: The disbelievers say, &lsquo;Why has no miracle been sent down to him from his Lord?&rsquo; [Prophet], say, &lsquo;God leaves whoever He will to stray, and guides to Himself those who turn towards Him,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:28" />28: those who have faith and whose hearts find peace in the remembrance of God- truly it is in the remembrance of God that hearts find peace-</p>
