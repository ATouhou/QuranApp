<p class="verse"><a name="23:90" />90: The fact is, We brought them the truth and they are lying.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:91" />91: God has never had a child. Nor is there any god beside Him- if there were, each god would have taken his creation aside and tried to overcome the others. May God be exalted above what they describe!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:92" />92: He knows what is not seen as well as what is seen; He is far above any partner they claim for Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:93" />93: Say, &lsquo;Lord, if You are going to show me the punishment You have promised them,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:94" />94: then Lord, do not include me among the evildoers!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:95" />95: We certainly are able to show you the punishment We have promised them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:96" />96: Repel evil with good- We are well aware of what they attribute to Us-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:97" />97: and say, &lsquo;Lord, I take refuge with You from the goadings of the evil ones;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:98" />98: I seek refuge with you, Lord, so that they may not come near me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:99" />99: When death comes to one of them, he cries, &lsquo;My Lord, let me return</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:100" />100: so as to make amends for the things I neglected.&rsquo; Never! This will not go beyond his words: a barrier stands behind such people until the very Day they are resurrected.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:101" />101: On that Day when the Trumpet is blown, the ties between them will be as nothing and they will not ask about each other:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:102" />102: those whose good deeds weigh heavy will be successful,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:103" />103: but those whose balance is light will have lost their souls for ever and will stay in Hell-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:104" />104: the Fire will scorch their faces and their lips will be twisted in pain.</p>
