<p class="verse"><a name="7:156" />156: Grant us good things in this world and in the life to come. We turn to You.&rsquo; God said, &lsquo;I bring My punishment on whoever I will, but My mercy encompasses all things. &lsquo;I shall ordain My mercy for those who are conscious of God and pay the prescribed alms; who believe in Our Revelations;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:157" />157: who follow the Messenger- the unlettered prophet they find described in the Torah that is with them, and in the Gospel- who commands them to do right and forbids them to do wrong, who makes good things lawful to them and bad things unlawful, and relieves them of their burdens, and the iron collars that were on them. So it is those who believe him, honour and help him, and who follow the light which has been sent down with him, who will succeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:158" />158: Say [Muhammad], &lsquo;People, I am the Messenger of God to you all, from Him who has control over the heavens and the earth. There is no God but Him; He gives life and death, so believe in God and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet who believes in God and His words, and follow him so that you may find guidance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:159" />159: There is a group among the people of Moses who guide with truth, and who act justly according to it.</p>
