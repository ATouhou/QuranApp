<p class="verse"><a name="11:29" />29: My people, I ask no reward for it from you; my reward comes only from God. I will not drive away the faithful: they are sure to meet their Lord. I can see you are foolish.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:30" />30: My people, who could help me against God if I drove the faithful away? Will you not take heed?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:31" />31: I am not telling you that I hold God&rsquo;s treasures, or have any knowledge of what is hidden, or that I am an angel. Nor do I say that God will not grant any good to those who are despised in your eyes: God Himself knows best what is in their souls. If I did this I would be one of the wrongdoers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:32" />32: They said, &lsquo;Noah! You have argued with us for too long. Bring down on us the punishment you threaten us with, if you are telling the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:33" />33: He said, &lsquo;It is God who will bring it down, if He wishes, and you will not be able to escape.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:34" />34: My advice will be no use to you if God wishes to leave you to your delusions: He is your Lord and to Him you will be returned.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:35" />35: If [these disbelievers] say, &lsquo;He has made this up,&rsquo; say [Muhammad], &lsquo;If I have made this up, I am responsible for my own crime, but I am innocent of the crimes you commit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:36" />36: It was revealed to Noah, &lsquo;None of your people will believe, other than those who have already done so, so do not be distressed by, what they do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:37" />37: Build the Ark under Our [watchful] eyes and with Our inspiration. Do not plead with Me for those who have done evil- they will be drowned.&rsquo;</p>
