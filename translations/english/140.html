<p class="verse"><a name="6:95" />95: It is God who splits open the seed and the fruit stone: He brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living- that is God- so how can you turn away from the truth?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:96" />96: He makes the dawn break; He makes the night for rest; and He made the sun and the moon to a precise measure. That is the design of the Almighty, the All Knowing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:97" />97: It is He who made the stars, so that they can guide you when land and sea are dark: We have made the signs clear for those who have knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:98" />98: It is He who first produced you from a single soul, then gave you a place to stay [in life] and a resting place [after death]. We have made Our revelations clear to those who understand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:99" />99: It is He who sends down water from the sky. With it We produce the shoots of each plant, then bring greenery from it, and from that We bring out grains, one riding on the other in close-packed rows. From the date palm come clusters of low-hanging dates, and there are gardens of vines, olives, and pomegranates, alike yet different. Watch their fruits as they grow and ripen! In all this there are signs for those who would believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:100" />100: Yet they made the jinn partners with God, though He created them, and without any true knowledge they attribute sons and daughters to Him. Glory be to Him! He is far higher than what they ascribe to Him,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:101" />101: the Creator of the heavens and earth! How could He have children when He has no spouse, when He created all things, and has full knowledge of all things?</p>
