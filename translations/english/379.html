<p class="verse"><a name="27:23" />23: I found a woman ruling over the people, who has been given a share of everything- she has a magnificent throne-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:24" />24: [but] I found that she and her people worshipped the sun instead of God. Satan has made their deeds seem alluring to them, and diverted them from the right path: they cannot find the right path.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="27:31" />31: do not put yourselves above me, and come to me in submission to God.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:32" />32: She said, &lsquo;Counsellors, give me your counsel in the matter I now face: I only ever decide on matters in your presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:33" />33: They replied, &lsquo;We possess great force and power in war, but you are in command, so consider what orders to give us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:34" />34: She said, &lsquo;Whenever kings go into a city, they ruin it and humiliate its leaders- that is what they do-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:35" />35: but I am going to send them a gift, then see what answer my envoys bring back.&rsquo;</p>
