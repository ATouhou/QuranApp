<p class="verse"><a name="21:26" />26: And they say, &lsquo;The Lord of Mercy has taken offspring for Himself.&rsquo; May He be exalted! No! They are only His honoured servants:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:27" />27: they do not speak before He speaks and they act by His command.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:28" />28: He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot intercede without His permission&ndash;&ndash;indeed they themselves stand in awe of Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:29" />29: If any of them were to claim, &lsquo;I am a god beside Him,&rsquo; We would reward them with Hell: this is how We reward evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:30" />30: Are the disbelievers not aware that the heavens and the earth used to be joined together and that We ripped them apart, that We made every living thing from water? Will they not believe?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:31" />31: And We put firm mountains on the earth, lest it should sway under them, and set broad paths on it, so that they might follow the right direction,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:32" />32: and We made the sky a well-secured canopy- yet from its wonders they turn away.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:33" />33: It is He who created night and day, the sun and the moon, each floating in its orbit.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:34" />34: We have not granted everlasting life to any other human being before you either [Muhammad]- if you die, will [the disbelievers] live for ever?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:35" />35: Every soul is certain to taste death: We test you all through the bad and the good, and to Us you will all return.</p>
