<p class="verse"><a name="3:11" />11: just as Pharaoh&rsquo;s people and their predecessors denied Our revelations, and God punished them for their sins: God is severe in punishing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:12" />12: [Prophet], say to the disbelievers, &lsquo;You will be defeated and driven together into Hell, a foul resting place.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:13" />13: You have already seen a sign in the two armies that met in battle, one fighting for God&rsquo;s cause and the other made up of disbelievers. With their own eyes [the former] saw [the latter] to be twice their number, but God helps whoever He will. There truly is a lesson in this for all with eyes to see.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:14" />14: The love of desirable things is made alluring for men- women, children, gold and silver treasures piled up high, horses with fine markings, livestock, and farmland- these may be the joys of this life, but God has the best place to return to.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:15" />15: [Prophet], say, &lsquo;Would you like me to tell you of things that are better than all of these? Their Lord will give those who are mindful of God Gardens graced with flowing streams, where they will stay with pure spouses and God&rsquo;s good pleasure- God is fully aware of His servants-</p>
