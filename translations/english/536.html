<p class="verse"><a name="56:52" />52: will eat from the bitter tree of Zaqqum,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:53" />53: filling your bellies with it,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:54" />54: and drink scalding water,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:55" />55: lapping it like thirsty camels.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:56" />56: This will be their welcome on the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:57" />57: It was We who created you: will you not believe?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:58" />58: Consider [the semen] you eject-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:59" />59: do you create it yourselves or are We the Creator?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:60" />60: We ordained death to be among you. Nothing could stop Us</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:61" />61: if We intended to change you and recreate you in a way unknown to you.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="56:70" />70: If We wanted, We could make it bitter: will you not be thankful?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:71" />71: Consider the fire you kindle-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:72" />72: is it you who make the wood for it grow or We?</p>
