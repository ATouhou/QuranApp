<p class="verse"><a name="20:114" />114: exalted be God, the one who is truly in control. [Prophet], do not rush to recite before the revelation is fully complete but say, &lsquo;Lord, increase me in knowledge!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:115" />115: We also commanded Adam before you, but he forgot and We found him lacking in constancy.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:116" />116: When We said to the angels, &lsquo;Bow down before Adam,&rsquo; they did. But Iblis refused,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:117" />117: so We said, &lsquo;Adam, this is your enemy, yours and your wife&rsquo;s: do not let him drive you out of the garden and make you miserable.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:118" />118: In the garden you will never go hungry, feel naked,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:119" />119: be thirsty, or suffer the heat of the sun.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:120" />120: But Satan whispered to Adam, saying, &lsquo;Adam, shall I show you the tree of immortality and power that never decays?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:121" />121: and they both ate from it. They became conscious of their nakedness and began to cover themselves with leaves from the garden. Adam disobeyed his Lord and was led astray-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:122" />122: later his Lord brought him close, accepted his repentance, and guided him-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:123" />123: God said, &lsquo;Get out of the garden as each other&rsquo;s enemy.&rsquo; Whoever follows My guidance, when it comes to you [people], will not go astray nor fall into misery,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:124" />124: but whoever turns away from it will have a life of great hardship. We shall bring him blind to the Assembly on the Day of Resurrection</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:125" />125: and he will say, &lsquo;Lord, why did You bring me here blind? I was sighted before!&rsquo;</p>
