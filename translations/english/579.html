<p class="verse"><a name="76:7" />7: They fulfil their vows; they fear a day of widespread woes;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:8" />8: they give food to the poor, the orphan, and the captive, though they love it themselves,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:9" />9: saying, &lsquo;We feed you for the sake of God alone: We seek neither recompense nor thanks from you.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:10" />10: We fear the Day of our Lord&ndash;&ndash;a woefully grim Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:11" />11: So God will save them from the woes of that Day, give them radiance and gladness,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:12" />12: and reward them, for their steadfastness, with a Garden and silken robes.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:13" />13: They will sit on couches, feeling neither scorching heat nor biting cold,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:14" />14: with shady [branches] spread above them and clusters of fruit hanging close at hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:15" />15: They will be served with silver plates</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:16" />16: and gleaming silver goblets according to their fancy,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:17" />17: and they will be given a drink infused with ginger</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:18" />18: from a spring called Salsabil.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:19" />19: Everlasting youths will attend them&ndash;&ndash;if you could see them, you would think they were scattered pearls&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:20" />20: and if you were to look around, you would see bliss and great wealth:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:21" />21: they will wear garments of green silk and brocade; they will be adorned with silver bracelets; their Lord will give them a pure drink.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:22" />22: [It will be said], &lsquo;This is your reward. Your endeavours are appreciated.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:23" />23: We Ourself have sent down this Quran to you [Prophet] in gradual revelation.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:24" />24: Await your Lord&rsquo;s Judgement with patience; do not yield to any of these sinners or disbelievers;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:25" />25: remember the name of your Lord at dawn and in the evening;</p>
