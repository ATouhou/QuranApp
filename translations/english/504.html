<p class="verse"><a name="46:15" />15: We have commanded man to be good to his parents: his mother struggled to carry him and struggled to give birth to him- his bearing and weaning took a full thirty months. When he has grown to manhood and reached the age of forty he [may] say, &lsquo;Lord, help me to be truly grateful for Your favours to me and to my parents; help me to do good work that pleases You; make my offspring good. I turn to You; I am one of those who devote themselves to You.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:16" />16: We accept from such people the best of what they do and We overlook their bad deeds. They will be among the people of Paradise- the true promise that has been given to them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:17" />17: But some say to their parents, &lsquo;What? Are you really warning me that I shall be raised alive from my grave, when so many generations have already passed and gone before me?&rsquo; His parents implore God for help; they say, &lsquo;Alas for you! Believe! God&rsquo;s promise is true,&rsquo; but still he replies, &lsquo;These are nothing but ancient fables.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:18" />18: The verdict has been passed on such people, along with all the communities that went before them, jinn and human: they are lost.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:19" />19: Everyone will be ranked according to their deeds and God will repay them in full for what they have done: they will not be wronged.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:20" />20: On the Day when those who deny the truth are brought before the Fire, it will be said to them, &lsquo;You squandered the good things you were given in your earthly life, you took your fill of pleasure there, so on this Day a punishment of shame is yours: you were arrogant on earth without any right, and exceeded all limits.&rsquo;</p>
