<p class="surah">Aal-e-Imran</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:1" />1: Alif Lam Mim</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:2" />2: God: there is no god but Him, the Ever Living, the Ever Watchful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:3" />3: Step by step, He has sent the Scripture down to you [Prophet] with the Truth, confirming what went before: He sent down the Torah and the Gospel</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:4" />4: earlier as a guide for people and He has sent down the distinction [between right and wrong]. Those who deny God&rsquo;s revelations will suffer severe torment: God is almighty and capable of retribution.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:5" />5: Nothing on earth or in heaven is hidden from God:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:6" />6: it is He who shapes you all in the womb as He pleases. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:7" />7: it is He who has sent this Scripture down to you [Prophet]. Some of its verses are definite in meaning- these are the cornerstone of the Scripture- and others are ambiguous. The perverse at heart eagerly pursue the ambiguities in their attempt to make trouble and to pin down a specific meaning of their own: only God knows the true meaning. Those firmly grounded in knowledge say, &lsquo;We believe in it: it is all from our Lord&rsquo;- only those with real perception will take heed-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:8" />8: &lsquo;Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate after You have guided us. Grant us Your mercy: You are the Ever Giving.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:9" />9: Our Lord, You will gather all people on the Day of which there is no doubt: God never breaks His promise.&rsquo;</p>
