<p class="verse"><a name="5:18" />18: The Jews and the Christians say, &lsquo;We are the children of God and His beloved ones.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Then why does He punish you for your sins? You are merely human beings, part of His creation: He forgives whoever He will and punishes whoever He will. Control of the heavens and earth and all that is between them belongs to Him: all journeys lead to Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:19" />19: People of the Book, Our Messenger comes to you now, after a break in the sequence of messengers, to make things clear for you in case you should say, &lsquo;No one has come to give us good news or to warn us.&rsquo; So someone has come to you, to give you good news and warn you: God has the power to do all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:20" />20: Moses said to his people, &lsquo;My people, remember God&rsquo;s blessing on you: how He raised prophets among you and appointed kings for you and gave you what he had not given to any other people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:21" />21: My people, go into the holy land which God has ordained for you&ndash;&ndash;do not turn back or you will be the losers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:22" />22: They said, &lsquo;Moses, there is a fearsome people in this land. We will not go there until they leave. If they leave, then we will enter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:23" />23: Yet two men whom God had blessed among those who were afraid said, &lsquo;Go in to them through the gate and when you go in you will overcome them. If you are true believers, put your trust in God.&rsquo;</p>
