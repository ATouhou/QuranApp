<p class="verse"><a name="3:133" />133: Hurry towards your Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness and a Garden as wide as the heavens and earth prepared for the righteous,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:134" />134: who give, both in prosperity and adversity, who restrain their anger and pardon people- God loves those who do good-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:135" />135: those who remember God and implore forgiveness for their sins if they do something shameful or wrong themselves- who forgives sins but God?- and who never knowingly persist in doing wrong.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:136" />136: The reward for such people is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens graced with flowing streams, where they will remain. How excellent is the reward of those who labour!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:137" />137: God&rsquo;s ways have operated before your time: travel through the land, and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:138" />138: This is a clear lesson to people, and guidance and teaching for those who are mindful of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:139" />139: Do not lose heart or despair- if you are true believers you have the upper hand-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:140" />140: if you have suffered a blow, they too have suffered one like it. We deal out such days among people in turn, for God to find out who truly believes, for Him to choose martyrs from among you- God does not love evildoers-</p>
