<p class="verse"><a name="6:133" />133: Your Lord is self-sufficient and full of mercy. If He pleased, He could remove you and put others in your place, just as He produced you from the offspring of other people.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="6:135" />135: [Prophet], say, &lsquo;My people, you carry on as you are, and so will I: you will come to realize who will have a happy homecoming in the Hereafter.&rsquo; The evildoers will not prosper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:136" />136: They apportion to God a share of the produce and the livestock He created, saying, &lsquo;This is for God&rsquo;- so they claim!- &lsquo; and this is for our idols.&rsquo; Their idols&rsquo; share does not reach God, but God&rsquo;s share does reach their idols: how badly they judge!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:137" />137: In the same way, their idols have induced many of the pagans to kill their own children, bringing them ruin and confusion in their faith: if God had willed otherwise they would not have done this, so [Prophet] leave them to their own devices.</p>
