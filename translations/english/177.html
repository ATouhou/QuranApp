<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:1" />1: They ask you [Prophet] about [distributing] the battle gains. Say, &lsquo;That is a matter for God and His Messenger, so be mindful of God and make things right between you. Obey God and His Messenger if you are true believers:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:2" />2: true believers are those whose hearts tremble with awe when God is mentioned, whose faith increases when His revelations are recited to them, who put their trust in their Lord,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:3" />3: who keep up the prayer and give to others out of what We provide for them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:4" />4: Those are the ones who truly believe. They have high standing with their Lord, forgiveness, and generous provision.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:5" />5: For it was your Lord who made you [Prophet] venture from your home for a true purpose&ndash;&ndash;though a group of the believers disliked it</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:6" />6: and argued with you about the truth after it had been made clear, as if they were being driven towards a death they could see with their own eyes.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:7" />7: Remember how God promised you [believers] that one of the two enemy groups would fall to you: you wanted the unarmed group to be yours, but it was God&rsquo;s will to establish the truth according to His Word and to finish off the disbelievers&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:8" />8: to prove the Truth to be true, and the false to be false, much as the guilty might dislike it.</p>
