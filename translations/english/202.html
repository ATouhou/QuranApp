<p class="verse"><a name="9:97" />97: The desert Arabs are the most stubborn of all peoples in their disbelief and hypocrisy. They are the least likely to recognize the limits that God has sent down to His Messenger. God is all knowing and all wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:98" />98: Some of the desert Arabs consider what they give to be an imposition; they are waiting for fortune to turn against you, but fortune will turn against them. God is all hearing and all knowing.</p>

God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
