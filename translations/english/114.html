<p class="verse"><a name="5:38" />38: Cut off the hands of thieves, whether they are man or woman, as punishment for what they have done- a deterrent from God: God is almighty and wise.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="5:40" />40: Do you [Prophet] not know that control of the heavens and earth belongs solely to God? He punishes whoever He will and forgives whoever He will: God has power over everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:41" />41: Messenger, do not be grieved by those who race to surpass one another in disbelief- those who say with their mouths, &lsquo;We believe,&rsquo; but have no faith in their hearts, and the Jews who listen eagerly to lies and to those who have not even met you, who distort the meanings of [revealed] words and say [to each other], &lsquo;If you are given this ruling, accept it, but if you are not, then beware!&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;if God intends some people to be so misguided, you will be powerless against God on their behalf. These are the ones whose hearts God does not intend to cleanse- a disgrace for them in this world, and then a heavy punishment in the Hereafter-</p>
