<p class="verse"><a name="18:85" />85: He travelled on a certain road;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:86" />86: then, when he came to the setting of the sun, he found it [seemed to be] setting into a muddy spring. Nearby he found some people and We said, &lsquo;Dhu &rsquo;l-Qarnayn, you may choose [which of them] to punish or show kindness to.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:87" />87: He answered, &lsquo;We shall punish those who have done evil, and when they are returned to their Lord He will punish them [even more] severely,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:88" />88: while those who believed and did good deeds will have the best of rewards: we shall command them to do what is easy for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:89" />89: He travelled on;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:90" />90: then, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:91" />91: And so it was: We knew all about him.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="18:95" />95: He answered, &lsquo;The power my Lord has given me is better than any tribute, but if you lend me your strength, I will put up a fortification between you and them:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:96" />96: bring me lumps of iron!&rsquo; and then, when he had filled the gap between the two mountainsides [he said], &lsquo;Work your bellows!&rsquo; and then, when he had made it glow like fire, he said, &lsquo;Bring me molten metal to pour over it!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:97" />97: Their enemies could not scale the barrier, nor could they pierce it,</p>
