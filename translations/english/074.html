<p class="verse"><a name="3:181" />181: God has certainly heard the words of those who sneer, &lsquo;So God is poor, while we are rich&rsquo;. We shall record everything they say&ndash;&ndash;as well as their killing of prophets in defiance of all that is right- and We shall say to them, &lsquo;Taste the torment of the scorching fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:182" />182: That is on account of what you stored up for yourselves with your own hands: God is never unjust to His servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:183" />183: To those who say, &lsquo;God has commanded us not to believe in any messenger unless he brings us an offering that fire [from heaven] consumes,&rsquo; say [Prophet], &lsquo;Messengers before me have come to you with clear signs, including the one you mention. If you are sincere, why did you kill them?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:184" />184: If they reject you, so have other messengers been rejected before you, even though they came with clear evidence, books of wisdom and enlightening scripture.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:185" />185: Every soul will taste death and you will be paid in full only on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is kept away from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have triumphed. The present world is only an illusory pleasure:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:186" />186: you are sure to be tested through your possessions and persons; you are sure to hear much that is hurtful from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with God. If you are steadfast and mindful of God, that is the best course.</p>
