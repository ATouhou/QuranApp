<p class="verse"><a name="2:17" />17: They are like people who [labour to] kindle a fire: when it lights up everything around them, God takes away all their light, leaving them in utter darkness, unable to see-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:18" />18: deaf, dumb, and blind: they will never return.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:19" />19: Or [like people who, under] a cloudburst from the sky, with its darkness, thunder, and lightning, put their fingers into their ears to keep out the thunderclaps for fear of death- God surrounds the disbelievers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:20" />20: The lightning almost snatches away their sight: whenever it crashes on</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:21" />21: People, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, so that you may be mindful [of Him]</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:22" />22: who spread out the earth for you and built the sky; who sent water down from it and with that water produced things for your sustenance. Do not, knowing this, set up rivals to God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:23" />23: If you have doubts about the revelation We have sent down to Our servant, then produce a single sura like it- enlist whatever supporters you have other than God- if you truly [think you can].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:24" />24: If you cannot do this- and you never will- then beware of the Fire prepared for the disbelievers, whose fuel is men and stones.</p>
