<p class="verse"><a name="2:70" />70: They said, &lsquo;Call on your Lord for us, to show us [exactly] what it is: all cows are more or less alike to us. With God&rsquo;s will, we shall be guided.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:71" />71: He replied, &lsquo;It is a perfect and unblemished cow, not trained to till the earth or water the fields.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Now you have brought the truth,&rsquo; and so they slaughtered it, though they almost failed to do so.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:72" />72: Then, when you [Israelites] killed someone and started to blame one another- although God was to bring what you had concealed to light-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:73" />73: We said, &lsquo;Strike the [body] with a part of [the cow]&rsquo;: thus God brings the dead to life and shows His signs so that you may understand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:74" />74: Even after that, your hearts became as hard as rocks, or even harder, for there are rocks from which streams spring out, and some from which water comes when they split open, and others which fall down in awe of God: He is not unaware of what you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:75" />75: So can you [believers] hope that such people will believe you, when some of them used to hear the words of God and then deliberately twist them, even when they understood them?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:76" />76: When they meet the believers, they say, &lsquo;We too believe.&rsquo; But when they are alone with each other they say, &lsquo;How could you tell them about God&rsquo;s revelation [to us]? They will be able to use it to argue against you before your Lord! Have you no sense?&rsquo;</p>
