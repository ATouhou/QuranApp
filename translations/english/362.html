<p class="verse"><a name="25:21" />21: Those who do not fear to meet Us say, &lsquo;Why are the angels not sent down to us?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Why can we not see our Lord?&rsquo; They are too proud of themselves and too insolent.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:22" />22: There will be no good news for the guilty on the Day they see the angels. The angels will say, &lsquo;You cannot cross the forbidden barrier,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:23" />23: and We shall turn to the deeds they have done and scatter them like dust.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:24" />24: But the companions in the Garden will have a better home on that Day, and a fairer place to rest.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:25" />25: On the Day when the sky and its clouds are split apart and the angels sent down in streams,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:26" />26: on that Day, true authority belongs to the Lord of Mercy. It will be a grievous Day for the disbelievers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:27" />27: On that Day the evildoer will bite his own hand and say, &lsquo;If only I had taken the same path as the Messenger.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:28" />28: Woe is me! If only I had not taken so and so as a friend-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:29" />29: he led me away from the Revelation after it reached me. Satan has always betrayed mankind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:30" />30: The Messenger has said, &lsquo;Lord, my people treat this Quran as something to be shunned,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:31" />31: but We have always appointed adversaries from the wicked, for every prophet: Your Lord is sufficient guide and helper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:32" />32: The disbelievers also say, &lsquo;Why was the Quran not sent down to him all at once?&rsquo; We sent it in this way to strengthen your heart [Prophet]; We gave it to you in gradual revelation.</p>
