<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:1" />1: Truly We have opened up a path to clear triumph for you [Prophet],</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:2" />2: so that God may forgive you your past and future sins, complete His grace upon you, guide you to a straight path,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:3" />3: and help you mightily.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:4" />4: It was He who made His tranquillity descend into the hearts of the believers, to add faith to their faith&ndash;&ndash;the forces of the heavens and earth belong to God; He is all knowing and all wise&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:5" />5: so as to admit believing men and women into Gardens graced with flowing streams, there to remain, absolving their bad deeds&ndash;&ndash;a great triumph in God&rsquo;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:6" />6: and to torment the hypocritical and idolatrous men and women who harbour evil thoughts about God&ndash;&ndash;it is they who will be encircled by evil!&ndash;&ndash;who carry the burden of God&rsquo;s anger, whom God has rejected and for whom He has prepared Hell, an evil destination!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:7" />7: The forces of heaven and earth belong to God; He is almighty and all wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:8" />8: We have sent you [Prophet] to bring good news and to give warning,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:9" />9: so that you[people] may believe in God and His Messenger, support Him, honour Him, and praise Him morning and evening.</p>
