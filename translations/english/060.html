<p class="verse"><a name="3:78" />78: There are some who twist the Scripture with their tongues to make you [people] think that what they say is part of the Scripture when it is not; they say it is from God when it is not; they attribute lies to God and they know it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:79" />79: No person to whom God had given the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood would ever say to people, &lsquo;Be my servants, not God&rsquo;s.&rsquo; [He would say], &lsquo;You should be devoted to God because you have taught the Scripture and studied it closely.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:80" />80: He would never command you to take angels and prophets as lords. How could he command you to be disbelievers after you had devoted yourselves to God?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:81" />81: God took a pledge from the prophets, saying, &lsquo;If, after I have bestowed Scripture and wisdom upon you, a messenger comes confirming what you have been given, you must believe in him and support him. Do you affirm this and accept My pledge as binding on you?&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;We do.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Then bear witness and I too will bear witness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:82" />82: Those who turn away after this are the ones who break pledges.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:83" />83: Do they seek anything other than submission to God? Everyone in the heavens and earth submits to Him, willingly or unwillingly; they will all be returned to Him.</p>
