<p class="verse"><a name="37:128" />128: not so the true servants of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:129" />129: We let him be praised by succeeding generations:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:130" />130: &lsquo;Peace be to Elijah!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:131" />131: This is how We reward those who do good:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:132" />132: truly he was one of Our faithful servants.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:133" />133: Lot was also one of the messengers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:134" />134: We saved him and all his family-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:135" />135: except for an old woman who stayed behind-</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="37:146" />146: and made a gourd tree grow above him.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="37:153" />153: Did He truly choose daughters in preference to sons?</p>
