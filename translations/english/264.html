<p class="verse"><a name="15:32" />32: God said, &lsquo;Iblis, why did you not bow down like the others?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:33" />33: and he answered, &lsquo;I will not bow to a mortal You created from dried clay, formed from dark mud.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:34" />34: &lsquo;Get out of here!&rsquo; said God. &lsquo;You are an outcast,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:35" />35: rejected until the Day of Judgement.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:36" />36: Iblis said, &lsquo;My Lord, give me respite until the Day when they are raised from the dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:37" />37: &lsquo;You have respite,&rsquo; said God,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:38" />38: &lsquo;until the Day of the Appointed Time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:39" />39: Iblis then said to God, &lsquo;Because You have put me in the wrong, I will lure mankind on earth and put them in the wrong,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:40" />40: all except Your devoted servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:41" />41: God said, &lsquo;[Devotion] is a straight path to Me:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:42" />42: you will have no power over My servants, only over the ones who go astray and follow you.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:43" />43: Hell is the promised place for all these,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:44" />44: with seven gates, each gate having its allotted share of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:45" />45: But the righteous will be in Gardens with springs-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:46" />46: &ldquo;Enter them in peace and safety!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:47" />47: and We shall remove any bitterness from their hearts: [they will be like] brothers, sitting on couches, face to face.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:48" />48: No weariness will ever touch them there, nor will they ever be expelled.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:49" />49: [Prophet], tell My servants that I am the Forgiving, the Merciful,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:50" />50: but My torment is the truly painful one.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:51" />51: Tell them too about Abraham&rsquo;s guests:</p>
