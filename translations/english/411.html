<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:1" />1: Alif Lam Mim</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:2" />2: These are the verses of the wise Scripture,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:3" />3: [with] guidance and mercy for those who do good,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:4" />4: who keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, and are certain of the Hereafter:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:5" />5: these are rightly guided by their Lord, and it is they who will prosper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:6" />6: But there is the sort of person who pays for distracting tales, intending, without any knowledge, to lead others from God&rsquo;s way, and to hold it up to ridicule. There will be humiliating torment for him!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:7" />7: When Our verses are recited to him, he turns away disdainfully as if he had not heard them, as if there were heaviness in his ears. Tell him that there will be a painful torment!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:8" />8: But for those who believe and do righteous deeds, there will be Gardens of bliss</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:9" />9: where they will stay: that is God&rsquo;s true promise, and He is the Almighty, the All Wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:10" />10: He created the heavens without any visible support, and He placed firm mountains on the earth&ndash;&ndash;in case it should shake under you&ndash;&ndash;and He spread all kinds of animals around it. We sent down water from the sky, with which We made every kind of good plant grow on earth:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:11" />11: all this is God&rsquo;s creation. Now, show Me what your other gods have created. No, the disbelievers are clearly astray.</p>
