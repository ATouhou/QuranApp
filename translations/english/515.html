<p class="verse"><a name="48:29" />29: Muhammad is the Messenger of God. Those who follow him are harsh towards the disbelievers and compassionate towards each other. You see them kneeling and prostrating, seeking God&rsquo;s bounty and His good pleasure: on their faces they bear the marks of their prostrations. This is how they are pictured in the Torah and the Gospel: like a seed that puts forth its shoot, becomes strong, grows thick, and rises on its stem to the delight of its sowers. So God infuriates the disbelievers through them; God promises forgiveness and a great reward to those who believe and do righteous deeds.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="49:1" />1: Believers, do not push yourselves forward in the presence of God and His Messenger&ndash;&ndash;be mindful of God: He hears and knows all&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="49:2" />2: believers, do not raise your voices above the Prophet&rsquo;s, do not raise your voice when speaking to him as you do to one another, or your [good] deeds may be cancelled out without you knowing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="49:3" />3: It is those who lower their voices in the presence of God&rsquo;s Messenger whose hearts God has proved to be aware&ndash;&ndash;they will have forgiveness, and a great reward&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="49:4" />4: but most of those who shout to you [Prophet] from outside your private rooms lack understanding.</p>
