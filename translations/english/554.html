<p class="verse"><a name="62:9" />9: Believers! When the call to prayer is made on the day of congregation, hurry towards the reminder of God and leave off your trading&ndash;&ndash;that is better for you, if only you knew&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:10" />10: then when the prayer has ended, disperse in the land and seek out God&rsquo;s bounty. Remember God often so that you may prosper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:11" />11: Yet they scatter towards trade or entertainment whenever they observe it, and leave you [Prophet] standing there. Say, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s gift is better than any entertainment or trade: God is the best provider.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="63:1" />1: When the hypocrites come to you [Prophet], they say, &lsquo;We bear witness that you are the Messenger of God.&rsquo; God knows that you truly are His Messenger and He bears witness that the hypocrites are liars&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="63:2" />2: they use their oaths as a cover and so bar others from God&rsquo;s way: what they have been doing is truly evil&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="63:3" />3: because they professed faith and then rejected it, so their hearts have been sealed and they do not understand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="63:4" />4: When you see them [Prophet], their outward appearance pleases you; when they speak, you listen to what they say. But they are like propped-up tim-bers&ndash;&ndash;they think every cry they hear is against them&ndash;&ndash;and they are the enemy. Beware of them. May God confound them! How devious they are!</p>
