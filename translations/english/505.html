<p class="verse"><a name="46:21" />21: Mention [Hud] of the tribe of Ad: he warned his people among the sand dunes- other warners have come and gone both before and after him- &lsquo; Worship no one but God: I fear for you, that you will be punished on a terrible Day,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:22" />22: but they said, &lsquo;Have you come to turn us away from our gods? If what you say is true, bring down that punishment you threaten us with!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:23" />23: He said, &lsquo;Only God knows when it will come: I simply convey to you the message I am sent with but I can see you are an insolent people.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:24" />24: When they saw a cloud approaching their valley, they said, &lsquo;This cloud will give us rain!&rsquo; &lsquo;No indeed! It is what you wanted to hasten: a storm-wind bearing a painful punishment</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:25" />25: which will destroy everything by its Lord&rsquo;s command.&rsquo; In the morning there was nothing to see except their [ruined] dwellings: this is how We repay the guilty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:26" />26: We had established them in a way we have not established you [people of Mecca]; We gave them hearing, sight, and hearts, yet their hearing, sight, and hearts were of no use to them, since they denied God&rsquo;s revelations. They were overwhelmed by the punishment they had mocked.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:27" />27: We have also destroyed other communities that once flourished around you- We had given them various signs so that they might return to the right way-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:28" />28: so why did their gods not help them, those they set up as gods besides God to bring them nearer to Him? No indeed! They failed them utterly: it was all a lie of their own making.</p>
