<p class="verse"><a name="3:84" />84: Say [Muhammad], &lsquo;We [Muslims] believe in God and in what has been sent down to us and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes. We believe in what has been given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord. We do not make a distinction between any of the [prophets]. It is to Him that we devote ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:85" />85: If anyone seeks a religion other than [islam] complete devotion to God, it will not be accepted from him: he will be one of the losers in the Hereafter.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:86" />86: Why would God guide people who deny the truth, after they have believed and acknowledged that the Messenger is true, and after they have been shown clear proof? God does not guide evildoers:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:87" />87: such people will be rewarded with rejection by God, by the angels, by all people,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:88" />88: and so they will remain, with no relief or respite for their suffering.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:89" />89: Not so those who afterwards repent and mend their ways- God is most forgiving and merciful-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:90" />90: [although] the repentance of those who, having believed, then increase in their disbelief, will not be accepted. They are the ones who have gone [far] astray:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:91" />91: those who disbelieve and die disbelievers will not be saved even if they offer enough gold to fill the entire earth. Agonizing torment is in store for them, and there will be no one to help them.</p>
