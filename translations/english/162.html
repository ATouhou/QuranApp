<p class="verse"><a name="7:88" />88: His people&rsquo;s arrogant leaders said, &lsquo;Shuayb, we will expel you and your fellow believers from our town unless you return to our religion.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;What! Even if we detest it?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:89" />89: If we were to return to your religion after God has saved us from it, we would be inventing lies about Him: there is no way we could return to it- unless by the will of God our Lord: in His knowledge He comprehends everything. We put our trust in God. Our Lord, expose the truth [and judge] between us and our people, for You are the best judge.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:90" />90: The disbelieving leaders among his people said, &lsquo;You will certainly be losers if you follow Shuayb&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:91" />91: an earthquake seized them: by the next morning they were lying dead in their homes;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:92" />92: it was as if those who had rejected Shuayb had never lived there; it was those who had rejected Shuayb who were the losers-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:93" />93: so he turned away from them, saying, &lsquo;My people, I delivered my Lord&rsquo;s messages to you and gave you sincere advice, so why should I grieve for people who refused to believe?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:94" />94: Whenever We sent a prophet to a town, We afflicted its [disbelieving] people with suffering and hardships, so that they might humble themselves [before God],</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:95" />95: and then We changed their hardship into prosperity, until they multiplied. But then they said, &lsquo;Hardship and affluence also befell our forefathers,&rsquo; and so We took them suddenly, unawares.</p>
