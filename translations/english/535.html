<p class="verse"><a name="56:22" />22: and beautiful companions</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:23" />23: like hidden pearls:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:24" />24: a reward for what they used to do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:25" />25: They will hear no idle or sinful talk there,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:26" />26: only clean and wholesome speech.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:27" />27: Those on the Right, what people they are!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:28" />28: They will dwell amid thornless lote trees</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:29" />29: and clustered acacia</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:30" />30: with spreading shade,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:31" />31: constantly flowing water,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:32" />32: abundant fruits,</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="56:39" />39: many from the past</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:40" />40: and many from later generations.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="56:44" />44: neither cool nor refreshing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:45" />45: Before, they overindulged in luxury</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="56:46" />46: and persisted in great sin,</p>
