<p class="verse"><a name="28:44" />44: You [Muhammad] were not present on the western side of the mountain when We gave Our command to Moses: you were not there-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:45" />45: We have brought into being many generations who lived long lives- you did not live among the people of Midian or recite Our Revelation to them- We have always sent messengers to people-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:46" />46: nor were you present on the side of Mount Sinai when We called out to Moses. But you too have been sent as an act of grace from your Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner has come before, so that they may take heed,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:47" />47: and may not say, if a disaster should befall them as a result of what they have done with their own hands, &lsquo;Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we might have followed Your message and become believers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:48" />48: Even now that Our truth has come to them, they say, &lsquo;Why has he not been given signs like those given to Moses?&rsquo; Did they not also deny the truth that was given to Moses before? They say, &lsquo;Two kinds of sor-cery, helping each other,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;We refuse to accept either of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:49" />49: Say [Muhammad], &lsquo;Then produce a book from God that gives better guidance than these two and I will follow it, if you are telling the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:50" />50: If they do not respond to you, you will know that they follow only their own desires. Who is further astray than the one who follows his own desires with no guidance from God? Truly God does not guide those who do wrong.</p>
