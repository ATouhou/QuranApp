<p class="verse"><a name="6:74" />74: Remember when Abraham said to his father, Azar, &lsquo;How can you take idols as gods? I see that you and your people have clearly gone astray.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:75" />75: In this way We showed Abraham [God&rsquo;s] mighty dominion over the heavens and the earth, so that he might be a firm believer.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:76" />76: When the night grew dark over him he saw a star and said, &lsquo;This is my Lord,&rsquo; but when it set, he said, &lsquo;I do not like things that set.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:77" />77: And when he saw the moon rising he said, &lsquo;This is my Lord,&rsquo; but when it too set, he said, &lsquo;If my Lord does not guide me, I shall be one of those who go astray.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:78" />78: Then he saw the sun rising and cried, &lsquo;This is my Lord! This is greater.&rsquo; But when the sun set, he said, &lsquo;My people, I disown all that you worship beside God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:79" />79: I have turned my face as a true believer towards Him who created the heavens and the earth. I am not one of the polytheists.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:80" />80: His people argued with him, and he said, &lsquo;How can you argue with me about God when He has guided me? I do not fear anything you associate with Him: unless my Lord wills [nothing can happen]. My Lord encompasses everything in His knowledge. How can you not take heed?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:81" />81: Why should I fear what you associate with Him? Why do you not fear to associate with Him things for which He has sent you no authority? Tell me, if you know the answer, which side has more right to feel secure?</p>
