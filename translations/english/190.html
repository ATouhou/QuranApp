<p class="verse"><a name="9:24" />24: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;If your fathers, sons, brothers, wives, tribes, the wealth you have acquired, the trade which you fear will decline, and the dwellings you love are dearer to you than God and His Messenger and the struggle in His cause, then wait until God brings about His punishment.&rsquo; God does not guide those who break away.</p>
