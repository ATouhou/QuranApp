<p class="verse"><a name="2:26" />26: God does not shy from drawing comparisons even with something as small as a gnat, or larger: the believers know it is the truth from their Lord, but the disbelievers say, &lsquo;What does God mean by such a comparison?&rsquo; Through it He makes many go astray and leads many to the right path. But it is only the rebels He makes go astray:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:27" />27: those who break their covenant with God after it has been confirmed, who sever the bonds that God has commanded to be joined, who spread corruption on the earth- these are the losers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:28" />28: How can you ignore God when you were lifeless and He gave you life, when He will cause you to die, then resurrect you to be returned to Him?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:29" />29: It was He who created all that is on the earth for you, then turned to the sky and made the seven heavens; it is He who has knowledge of all things.</p>
