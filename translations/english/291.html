<p class="verse"><a name="17:87" />87: if it were not for your Lord&rsquo;s mercy: His favour to you has been truly great.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:88" />88: Say, &lsquo;Even if all mankind and jinn came together to produce something like this Quran, they could not produce anything like it, however much they helped each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:89" />89: In this Quran, We have set out all kinds of examples for people, yet most of them persist in disbelieving.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:90" />90: They say, &lsquo;We will not believe for you [Muhammad] until you make a spring gush out of the ground for us;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:91" />91: or until you have a garden of date palms and vines, and make rivers pour through them;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:92" />92: or make the sky fall on us in pieces, as you claimed will happen; or bring God and the angels before us face to face;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:93" />93: or have a house made of gold; or ascend into the sky- even then, we will not believe in your ascension until you send a real book down for us to read.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Glory be to my Lord! Am I anything but a mortal, a messenger?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:94" />94: The only thing that kept these people from believing, when guidance came to them, was that they said, &lsquo;How could God have sent a human being as a messenger?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="17:96" />96: Say, &lsquo;God is witness enough between me and you. He knows and observes His servants well.&rsquo;</p>
