<p class="verse"><a name="2:197" />197: The pilgrimage takes place during the prescribed months. There should be no indecent speech, misbehaviour, or quarrelling for anyone undertaking the pilgrimage- whatever good you do, God is well aware of it. Provide well for yourselves: the best provision is to be mindful of God- always be mindful of Me, you who have understanding-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:198" />198: but it is no offence to seek some bounty from your Lord. When you surge down from Arafat remember God at the sacred place. Remember Him: He has guided you. Before that you were astray.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:199" />199: Surge down where the rest of the people do, and ask forgiveness of God: He is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:200" />200: When you have completed your rites, remember God as much as you remember your own fathers, or even more. There are some who pray, &lsquo;Our Lord, give us good in this world,&rsquo; and they will have no share in the Hereafter;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:201" />201: others pray, &lsquo;Our Lord, give us good in this world and in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:202" />202: They will have the share they have worked for: God is swift in reckoning.</p>
