<p class="verse"><a name="18:28" />28: Content yourself with those who pray to their Lord morning and evening, seeking His approval, and do not let your eyes turn away from them out of desire for the attractions of this worldly life: do not yield to those whose hearts We have made heedless of Our Quran, those who follow their own low desires, those whose ways are unbridled.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:29" />29: Say, &lsquo;Now the truth has come from your Lord: let those who wish to believe in it do so, and let those who wish to reject it do so.&rsquo; We have prepared a Fire for the wrongdoers that will envelop them from all sides. If they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like molten metal, scalding their faces. What a terrible drink! What a painful resting place!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:30" />30: As for those who believe and do good deeds- We do not let the reward of anyone who does a good deed go to waste-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:31" />31: they will have Gardens of lasting bliss graced with flowing streams. There they will be adorned with bracelets of gold. There they will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade. There they will be comfortably seated on soft chairs. What a blessed reward! What a pleasant resting place!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:32" />32: Tell them the parable of two men: for one of them We made two gardens of grape vines, surrounded them with date palms, and put corn fields in between;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:33" />33: both gardens yielded fruit and did not fail in any way; We made a stream flow through them,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:34" />34: and so he had abundant fruit. One day, while talking to his friend, he said, &lsquo;I have more wealth and a larger following than you.&rsquo;</p>
