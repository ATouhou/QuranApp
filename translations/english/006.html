<p class="verse"><a name="2:31" />31: He taught Adam all the names [of things], then He showed them to the angels and said, &lsquo;Tell me the names of these if you truly [think you can].&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="2:34" />34: When We told the angels, &lsquo;Bow down before Adam,&rsquo; they all bowed. But not Iblis, who refused and was arrogant: he was one of the disobedient.</p>
