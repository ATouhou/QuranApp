<p class="verse"><a name="7:12" />12: God said, &lsquo;What prevented you from bowing down as I commanded you?&rsquo; and he said, &lsquo;I am better than him: You created me from fire and him from clay.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:13" />13: God said, &lsquo;Get down from here! This is no place for your arrogance. Get out! You are contemptible!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:14" />14: but Iblis said, &lsquo;Give me respite until the Day people are raised from the dead,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:15" />15: and God replied, &lsquo;You have respite.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:16" />16: And then Iblis said, &lsquo;Because You have put me in the wrong, I will lie in wait for them all on Your straight path:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:17" />17: I will come at them- from their front and their back, from their right and their left- and You will find that most of them are ungrateful.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:18" />18: God said, &lsquo;Get out! You are disgraced and banished! I swear I shall fill Hell with you and all who follow you!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:19" />19: But you and your wife, Adam, live in the Garden. Both of you eat whatever you like, but do not go near this tree or you will become wrongdoers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:20" />20: Satan whispered to them so as to expose their nakedness, which had been hidden from them: he said, &lsquo;Your Lord only forbade you this tree to prevent you becoming angels or immortals,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:21" />21: and he swore to them, &lsquo;I am giving you sincere advice&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:22" />22: he lured them with lies. Their nakedness became exposed to them when they had eaten from the tree: they began to put together leaves from the Garden to cover themselves. Their Lord called to them, &lsquo;Did I not forbid you to approach that tree? Did I not warn you that Satan was your sworn enemy?&rsquo;</p>
