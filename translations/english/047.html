<p class="verse"><a name="2:275" />275: But those who take usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan&rsquo;s touch. That is because they say, &lsquo;Trade and usury are the same,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:276" />276: but God has allowed trade and forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving God&rsquo;s warning, stops taking usury may keep his past gains- God will be his judge- but whoever goes back to usury will be an inhabitant of the Fire, there to remain. God blights usury, but blesses charitable deeds with multiple increase: He does not love the ungrateful sinner.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:277" />277: Those who believe, do good deeds, keep up the prayer, and pay the prescribed alms will have their reward with their Lord: no fear for them, nor will they grieve.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:278" />278: You who believe, beware of God: give up any outstanding dues from usury, if you are true believers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:279" />279: If you do not, then be warned of war from God and His Messenger. You shall have your capital if you repent, and without suffering loss or causing others to suffer loss.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:280" />280: If the debtor is in difficulty, then delay things until matters become easier for him; still, if you were to write it off as an act of charity, that would be better for you, if only you knew.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:281" />281: Beware of a Day when you will be returned to God: every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and no one will be wronged.</p>
