<p class="verse"><a name="9:15" />15: and remove the rage from their hearts. God turns to whoever He will in His mercy; God is all knowing and wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:16" />16: Do you think that you will be left untestedwithout God identifying which of you will strive for His cause and take no supporters apart from God, His Messenger, and other believers? God is fully aware of all your actions.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:17" />17: It is not right for the idolaters to tend God&rsquo;s places of worship while testifying to their own disbelief: the deeds of such people will come to nothing and they will abide in Hell.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:18" />18: The only ones who should tend God&rsquo;s places of worship are those who believe in God and the Last Day, who keep up the prayer, who pay the prescribed alms, and who fear no one but God: such people may hope to be among the rightly guided.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:19" />19: Do you consider giving water to pilgrims and tending the Sacred Mosque to be equal to the deeds of those who believe in God and the Last Day and who strive in God&rsquo;s path? They are not equal in God&rsquo;s eyes. God does not guide such benighted people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:20" />20: Those who believe, who migrated and strove hard in God&rsquo;s way with their possessions and their persons, are in God&rsquo;s eyes much higher in rank; it is they who will triumph;</p>
