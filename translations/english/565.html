<p class="verse"><a name="68:16" />16: We shall brand him on the snout!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:17" />17: We have tried them as We tried the owners of a certain garden, who swore that they would harvest its fruits in the morning</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:18" />18: and made no allowance [for the Will of God]:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:19" />19: a disaster from your Lord struck the garden as they slept</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:20" />20: and by morning it was stripped bare, a desolate land.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:21" />21: Still they called each other at daybreak,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:22" />22: &lsquo;Go early to your field if you wish to gather all its fruits,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:23" />23: and went off, whispering,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:24" />24: &lsquo;Make sure no poor person enters the garden today!&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:25" />25: they left early, bent on their purpose-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:26" />26: but when they saw the garden, they said, &lsquo;We must have lost our way!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:27" />27: No- we are ruined!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:28" />28: The wisest of them said, &lsquo;Did I not say to you, &ldquo;Will you not glorify God?&rdquo;&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:29" />29: they said, &lsquo;Glory be to God, Our Lord! Truly, we were doing wrong!&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:30" />30: and then they turned to each other in mutual reproach.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:31" />31: They said, &lsquo;Alas for us! We have done terrible wrong,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:32" />32: but maybe our Lord will give us something better in its place: we truly turn to Him in hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:33" />33: Such is the punishment [in this life], but greater still is the punishment in the Hereafter, if only they knew.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:34" />34: There will be Gardens of bliss for those who are mindful of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:35" />35: Should We treat those who submit to Us as We treat those who do evil?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:36" />36: What is the matter with you? On what basis do you judge?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:37" />37: Do you have a Scripture that tells you</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:38" />38: that you will be granted whatever you choose?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:39" />39: Have you received from Us solemn oaths, binding to the Day of Resurrection, that you will get whatever you yourselves decide?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:40" />40: Ask them [Prophet] which of them will guarantee this.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:41" />41: Do they have &lsquo;partners&rsquo; [besides God]? Let them produce their &lsquo;partners&rsquo;, if what they say is true.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="68:42" />42: On the Day when matters become dire, they will be invited to prostrate themselves but will be prevented from doing so,</p>
