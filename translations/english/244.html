<p class="verse"><a name="12:70" />70: and, once he had given them their provisions, he placed the drinking-cup in his brother&rsquo;s pack. A man called out, &lsquo;People of the caravan! You are thieves!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:71" />71: and they turned and said, &lsquo;What have you lost?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:72" />72: They replied, &lsquo;The king&rsquo;s drinking-cup is missing,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;Whoever returns it will get a camel-load [of grain],&rsquo; and, &lsquo;I give you my word.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:73" />73: They said, &lsquo;By God! You must know that we did not come to make mischief in your land: we are no thieves.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:74" />74: They asked them, &lsquo;And if we find that you are lying, what penalty shall we apply to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:75" />75: and they answered, &lsquo;The penalty will be [the enslavement of] the person in whose bag the cup is found: this is how we punish wrongdoers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:76" />76: [Joseph] began by searching their bags, then his brother&rsquo;s, and he pulled it out from his brother&rsquo;s bag. In this way We devised a plan for Joseph- if God had not willed it so, he could not have detained his brother as a penalty under the king&rsquo;s law- We raise the rank of whoever We will. Above everyone who has knowledge there is the One who is all knowing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:77" />77: [His brothers] said, &lsquo;If he is a thief then his brother was a thief before him,&rsquo; but Joseph kept his secrets and did not reveal anything to them. He said, &lsquo;You are in a far worse situation. God knows best the truth of what you claim.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:78" />78: They said, &lsquo;Mighty governor, he has an elderly father. Take one of us in his place. We can see that you are a very good man.&rsquo;</p>
