<p class="verse"><a name="2:155" />155: We shall certainly test you with fear and hunger, and loss of property, lives, and crops. But [Prophet], give good news to those who are steadfast,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:156" />156: those who say, when afflicted with a calamity, &lsquo;We belong to God and to Him we shall return.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:157" />157: These will be given blessings and mercy from their Lord, and it is they who are rightly guided.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:158" />158: Safa and Marwa are among the rites of God, so for those who make major or minor pilgrimage to the House it is no offence to circulate between the two.

<p class="verse"><a name="2:159" />159: As for those who hide the proofs and guidance We send down, after We have made them clear to people in the Scripture, God rejects them, and so do others,</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="2:161" />161: As for those who disbelieve and die as disbelievers, God rejects them, as do the angels and all people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:162" />162: They will remain in this state of rejection: their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:163" />163: Your God is the one God: there is no god except Him, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy.</p>
