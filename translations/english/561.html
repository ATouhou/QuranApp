<p class="verse"><a name="66:8" />8: Believers, turn to God in sincere repentance. Your Lord may well cancel your bad deeds for you and admit you into Gardens graced with flowing streams, on a Day when God will not disgrace the Prophet or those who have believed with him. With their lights streaming out ahead of them and to their right, they will say, &lsquo;Lord, perfect our lights for us and forgive us: You have power over everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:9" />9: Prophet, strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Deal with them sternly. Hell will be their home, an evil destination!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:10" />10: God has given examples of disbelievers: the wives of Noah and Lot who married two of Our righteous servants but betrayed them. Their husbands could not help them against God: it was said, &lsquo;Both of you enter the Fire with the others.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:11" />11: God has also given examples of believers: Pharaoh&rsquo;s wife, who said, &lsquo;Lord, build me a house near You in the Garden. Save me from Pharaoh and his actions; save me from the evildoers,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="66:12" />12: and Mary, daughter of Imran. She guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her from Our spirit. She accepted the truth of her Lord&rsquo;s words and Scriptures: she was truly devout.</p>
