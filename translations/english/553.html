<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:1" />1: Everything in the heavens and earth glorifies God, the Controller, the Holy One, the Almighty, the Wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:2" />2: It is He who raised a mes-senger, among the people who had no Scripture, to recite His revelations to them, to make them grow spiritually and teach them the Scripture and wisdom&ndash;&ndash;before that they were clearly astray&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:3" />3: to them and others yet to join them. He is the Almighty, the Wise:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:4" />4: such is God&rsquo;s favour that He grants it to whoever He will; God&rsquo;s favour is immense.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:5" />5: Those who have been charged to obey the Torah, but do not do so, are like asses carrying books: how base such people are who disobey God&rsquo;s revelations! God does not guide people who do wrong.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:6" />6: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;You who follow the Jewish faith, if you truly claim that out of all people you alone are friends of God, then you should be hoping for death.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:7" />7: But because of what they have stored up for themselves with their own hands they would never hope for death&ndash;&ndash;God knows the wrongdoers very well&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="62:8" />8: so say, &lsquo;The death you run away from will come to meet you and you will be returned to the One who knows the unseen as well as the seen: He will tell you everything you have done.&rsquo;</p>
