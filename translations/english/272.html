<p class="verse"><a name="16:43" />43: [Prophet], all the messengers We sent before you were simply men to whom We had given the Revelation: you [people] can ask those who have knowledge if you do not know.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:44" />44: We sent them with clear signs and scriptures. We have sent down the message to you too [Prophet], so that you can explain to people what was sent for them, so that they may reflect.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:45" />45: Are those who plan evil so sure that God will not make the earth swallow them up, that punishment will not come on them from some unimagined direction,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:46" />46: that it will not catch them suddenly in the midst of their comings and goings- for they cannot frustrate God-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:47" />47: or that it will not catch up with them gradually? Indeed your Lord is kind and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:48" />48: Do the [disbelievers] not observe the things that God has created, casting their shadows right and left, submitting themselves to God obediently?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:49" />49: It is to God that everything in the heavens and earth submits, every beast that moves, even the angels- they are free from arrogance:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:50" />50: they fear their Lord above them, and they do as they are commanded.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:51" />51: God said, &lsquo;Do not take two gods&rsquo;- for He is the One God&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo; I alone am the One that you should hold in awe.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:52" />52: Everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him: everlasting obedience is His right. Will you heed anyone other than God?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:53" />53: Whatever good things you possess come from God, and when hardship afflicts you, it is to Him alone you cry out for help,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:54" />54: yet when He has relieved you of your hardship- lo and behold!- some of you attribute partners to your Lord.</p>
