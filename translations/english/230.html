<p class="verse"><a name="11:73" />73: They said, &lsquo;Are you astonished at what God ordains? The grace of God and His blessings be upon you, people of this house! For He is worthy of all praise and glory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:74" />74: Then, when the fear left Abraham and the good news came to him, he pleaded with Us for Lot&rsquo;s people,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:75" />75: for Abraham was forbearing, tender-hearted, and devout.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:76" />76: &lsquo;Abraham, cease your pleading: what your Lord has ordained has come about; punishment is coming to them, which cannot be turned back.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="11:79" />79: They said, &lsquo;You know very well that we have no right to your daughters. You know very well what we want.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="11:81" />81: They [the messengers] said, &lsquo;Lot, we are your Lord&rsquo;s messengers. They will not reach you. Leave with your household in the dead of night, and let none of you turn back. Only your wife will suffer the fate that befalls the others. Their appointed time is the morning: is the morning not near?&rsquo;</p>
