<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:1" />1: Alif Lam Ra These are the verses of the wise Book.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:2" />2: Is it so surprising to people that We have revealed to a man from among them that he should warn people, and give glad news to those who believe, that they are on a sure footing with their Lord? [Yet] those who disbelieve say, &lsquo;This man is clearly a sorcerer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:3" />3: Your Lord is God who created the heavens and earth in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne, governing everything; there is no one that can intercede with Him, unless He has first given permission: this is God your Lord so worship Him. How can you not take heed?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:4" />4: It is to Him you shall all return&ndash;&ndash;that is a true promise from God. It was He who created [you] in the first place, and He will do so again, so that He may justly reward those who believe and do good deeds. But the disbelievers will have a drink of scalding water, and agonizing torment, because they persistently disbelieved.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:5" />5: It is He who made the sun a shining radiance and the moon a light, determining phases for it so that you might know the number of years and how to calculate time. God did not create all these without a true purpose; He explains His signs to those who understand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:6" />6: In the succession of night and day, and in what God created in the heavens and earth, there truly are signs for those who are aware of Him.</p>
