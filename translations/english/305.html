<p class="verse"><a name="19:2" />2: This is an account of your Lord&rsquo;s grace towards His servant, Zachariah,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:3" />3: when he called to his Lord secretly, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:4" />4: &lsquo;Lord, my bones have weakened and my hair is ashen grey, but never, Lord, have I ever prayed to You in vain:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:5" />5: I fear [what] my kinsmen [will do] when I am gone, for my wife is barren, so grant me a successor&ndash;&ndash;a gift from You&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:6" />6: to be my heir and the heir of the family of Jacob. Lord, make him well pleasing [to You].&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:7" />7: &lsquo;Zachariah, We bring you good news of a son whose name will be John&ndash;&ndash;We have chosen this name for no one before him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:8" />8: He said, &lsquo;Lord, how can I have a son when my wife is barren, and I am old and frail?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:9" />9: He said, &lsquo;This is what your Lord has said: &ldquo;It is easy for Me: I created you, though you were nothing before.&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:10" />10: He said, &lsquo;Give me a sign, Lord.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Your sign is that you will not [be able to] speak to anyone for three full [days and] nights.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:11" />11: He went out of the sanctuary to his people and signalled to them to praise God morning and evening.</p>
