<p class="verse"><a name="74:19" />19: devilishly he plotted!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:20" />20: ferociously he plotted!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:21" />21: and looked</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:22" />22: and frowned and scowled</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:23" />23: and turned away and behaved arrogantly</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:24" />24: and said, &lsquo;This is just old sorcery,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:25" />25: just the talk of a mortal!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:26" />26: I will throw him into the scorching Fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:27" />27: What will explain to you what the scorching Fire is?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:28" />28: It spares nothing and leaves nothing;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:29" />29: it scorches the flesh of humans;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:30" />30: there are nineteen in charge of it&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:31" />31: none other than angels appointed by Us to guard Hellfire- and We have made their number a test for the disbelievers. So those who have been given the Scripture will be certain and those who believe will have their faith increased: neither those who have been given the Scripture nor the believers will have any doubts, but the sick at heart and the disbelievers will say, &lsquo;What could God mean by this description?&rsquo; God leaves whoever He will to stray and guides whoever He will- no one knows your Lord&rsquo;s forces except Him- this [description] is a warning to mortals.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:32" />32: Yes&ndash;&ndash;by the moon!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:33" />33: By the departing night!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:34" />34: By the shining dawn!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:35" />35: It is one of the mightiest things,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:36" />36: a warning to all mortals,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:37" />37: to those of you who choose to go ahead and those who lag behind.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:38" />38: Every soul is held in pledge for its deeds,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:39" />39: but the Companions of the Right will stay</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:40" />40: in Gardens and ask</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:41" />41: about the guilty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:42" />42: &lsquo;What drove you to the Scorching Fire?&rsquo; [they will ask]</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:43" />43: and they will answer, &lsquo;We did not pray;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:44" />44: we did not feed the poor;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:45" />45: we indulged with others [in mocking the believers];</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:46" />46: we denied the Day of Judgement</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="74:47" />47: until the Certain End came upon us.&rsquo;</p>
