<p class="verse"><a name="6:48" />48: We send messengers only to give good news and to warn, so for those who believe and do good deeds there will be no fear, nor will they grieve.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="6:50" />50: Say, &lsquo;I do not have the treasures of God, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Is a blind person like one who can see? Why will you not reflect?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:51" />51: Use the Quran to warn those who fear being gathered before their Lord- they will have no one but Him to protect them and no one to intercede- so that they may beware.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:52" />52: Do not drive away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking nothing but His Face. You are in no way accountable for them, nor they for you; if you drove the believers away, you would become one of the evildoers.</p>
