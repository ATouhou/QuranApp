<p class="verse"><a name="3:71" />71: People of the Book, why do you mix truth with falsehood? Why do you hide the truth when you recognize it?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:72" />72: Some of the People of the Book say, &lsquo;At the beginning of the day, believe in what has been revealed to these believers [the Muslims], then at the end of the day reject it, so that they too may turn back,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:73" />73: but do not sincerely believe in anyone unless he follows your own religion&rsquo;- [Prophet], tell them, &lsquo;True guidance is the guidance of God&rsquo;- [they say], &lsquo;Do not believe that anyone else could be given a revelation similar to what you were given, or that they could use it to argue against you in your Lord&rsquo;s presence.&rsquo; [Prophet], tell them, &lsquo;All grace is in God&rsquo;s hands: He grants it to whoever He will- He is all embracing, all knowing-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:74" />74: and He singles out for His mercy whoever He will. His grace is infinite.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:75" />75: There are People of the Book who, if you [Prophet] entrust them with a heap of gold, will return it to you intact, but there are others of them who, if you entrust them with a single dinar, will not return it to you unless you keep standing over them, because they say, &lsquo;We are under no obligation towards the gentiles.&rsquo; They tell a lie against God and they know it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:76" />76: No indeed! God loves those who keep their pledges and are mindful of Him,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:77" />77: but those who sell out God&rsquo;s covenant and their own oaths for a small price will have no share in the life to come. God will neither speak to them nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection- He will not cleanse them [of their sins]- agonizing torment awaits them.</p>
