<p class="verse"><a name="9:37" />37: Postponing sacred months is another act of disobedience by which those who disregard [God] are led astray: they will allow it one year and forbid it in another in order outwardly to conform with the number of God&rsquo;s sacred months, but in doing so they permit what God has forbidden. Their evil deeds are made alluring to them: God does not guide those who disregard [Him].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:38" />38: Believers, why, when it is said to you, &lsquo;Go and fight in God&rsquo;s way,&rsquo; do you feel weighed down to the ground? Do you prefer this world to the life to come? How small the enjoyment of this world is, compared with the life to come!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:39" />39: If you do not go out and fight, God will punish you severely and put others in your place, but you cannot harm Him in any way: God has power over all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:40" />40: Even if you do not help the Prophet, God helped him when the disbelievers drove him out: when the two of them were in the cave, he [Muhammad] said to his companion, &lsquo;Do not worry, God is with us,&rsquo; and God sent His calm down to him, aided him with forces invisible to you, and brought down the disbelievers&rsquo; plan. God&rsquo;s plan is higher: God is almighty and wise.</p>
