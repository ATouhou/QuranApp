<p class="verse"><a name="28:60" />60: Whatever things you have been given for the life of this world are merely [temporary] gratification and vanity: that which is with God is better and more lasting- will you not use your reason?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:61" />61: Can the person who will see the fulfilment of the good promise We gave him be compared to someone We have given some enjoyments for this worldly life but who, on the Day of Resurrection, will be summoned?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:62" />62: The Day will come when God will call them, saying, &lsquo;Where now are those you allege are My partners?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:63" />63: and those [ringleaders] against whom the verdict will be passed will say, &lsquo;Our Lord, these are the ones we caused to deviate. We caused them to deviate as we ourselves deviated, but now we disown them before You: they did not really serve us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:64" />64: It will then be said to them, &lsquo;Now call those you worshipped as partners,&rsquo; and they will call them but receive no answer. They will see the suffering and wish they had followed guidance.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:65" />65: On that Day He will call them, saying, &lsquo;How did you respond to My messengers?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:66" />66: All arguments will seem obscure to them on that Day; they will not be able to consult one another.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:67" />67: Yet anyone who has repented, believed, and done good deeds can hope to find himself among the successful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:68" />68: Your Lord creates what He pleases and chooses those He will- they have no choice- so glory be to God, and may He be exalted above the partners they ascribe to Him!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:69" />69: Your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:70" />70: He is God; there is no god but Him; all praise belongs to Him in this world and the next; His is the Judgement; and to Him you shall be returned.</p>
