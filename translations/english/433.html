<p class="verse"><a name="34:40" />40: On the Day He gathers them all together, He will say to the angels, &lsquo;Was it you these people worshipped?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:41" />41: They will reply, &lsquo;May You be exalted! You are our supporter against them! Really, they worshipped the jinn- most of them believed in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:42" />42: &lsquo;So today neither of you has any power to benefit or harm the other,&rsquo; We shall tell the evildoers, &lsquo;Taste the torment of the fire which you called a lie.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:43" />43: When Our messages are recited to them, clear as they are, they say, &lsquo;This is only a man who wants to turn you away from what your forefathers worshipped,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;This [Quran] is nothing but lies he has made up.&rsquo; When the Truth comes to the disbelievers, they say, &lsquo;This is just plain sorcery,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:44" />44: though We have not given them any books to study nor sent any warner before you.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="34:48" />48: Say, &lsquo;My Lord hurls the Truth down [before you]. He has full knowledge of all that is unseen.&rsquo;</p>
