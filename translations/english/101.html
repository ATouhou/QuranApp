<p class="verse"><a name="4:141" />141: The [hypocrites] wait to see what happens to you and, if God brings you success, they say, &lsquo;Were we not on your side?&rsquo; but if the disbelievers have some success, they say to them, &lsquo;Did we not have the upper hand over you, and [yet] protect you from the believers?&rsquo; God will judge between you all on the Day of Resurrection, and He will give the disbelievers no means of overcoming the believers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:142" />142: The hypocrites try to deceive God, but it is He who causes them to be deceived. When they stand up to pray, they do so sluggishly, showing off in front of people, and remember God only a little,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:143" />143: wavering all the time between this and that, belonging neither to one side nor the other. If God leaves someone to stray, you [Prophet] will never find a way for him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:144" />144: You who believe, do not take the disbelievers as allies and protectors instead of the believers: do you want to offer God clear proof against you?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:145" />145: The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of Hell, and you will find no one to help them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:146" />146: Not so those who repent, mend their ways, hold fast to God, and devote their religion entirely to Him: these will be joined with the believers, and God will give the believers a mighty reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:147" />147: Why should God make you suffer torment if you are thankful and believe in Him? God always rewards gratitude and He knows everything.</p>
