<p class="verse"><a name="12:6" />6: This is about how your Lord will choose you, teach you to interpret dreams, and perfect His blessing on you and the House of Jacob, just as He perfected it earlier on your forefathers Abraham and Isaac: your Lord is all knowing and wise.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:7" />7: There are lessons in the story of Joseph and his brothers for all who seek them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:8" />8: The brothers said [to each other], &lsquo;Although we are many, Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are&ndash;&ndash; our father is clearly in the wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:9" />9: [One of them said], &lsquo;Kill Joseph or banish him to another land, and your father&rsquo;s attention will be free to turn to you. After that you can be righteous.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:10" />10: [Another of them] said, &lsquo;Do not kill Joseph, but, if you must, throw him into the hidden depths of a well where some caravan may pick him up.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="12:14" />14: They said, &lsquo;If a wolf were to eat him when there are so many of us, we would truly be losers!&rsquo;</p>
