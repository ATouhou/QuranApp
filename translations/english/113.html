<p class="verse"><a name="5:32" />32: On account of [his deed], We decreed to the Children of Israel that if anyone kills a person- unless in retribution for murder or spreading corruption in the land- it is as if he kills all mankind, while if any saves a life it is as if he saves the lives of all mankind. Our messengers came to them with clear signs, but many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:33" />33: Those who wage war against God and His Messenger and strive to spread corruption in the land should be punished by death, crucifixion, the amputation of an alternate hand and foot, or banishment from the land: a disgrace for them in this world, and then a terrible punishment in the Hereafter,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:34" />34: unless they repent before you overpower them- in that case bear in mind that God is forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:35" />35: You who believe, be mindful of God, seek ways to come closer to Him and strive for His cause, so that you may prosper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:36" />36: If the disbelievers possessed all that is in the earth and twice as much again and offered it to ransom themselves from torment on the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them- they will have a painful torment.</p>
