<p class="verse"><a name="7:131" />131: then, when something good came their way, they said, &lsquo;This is our due!&rsquo;. When something bad came, they ascribed it to the evil omen of Moses and those with him, but their &lsquo;evil omen&rsquo; was really from God, though most of them did not realize it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:132" />132: They said, &lsquo;We will not believe in you, no matter what signs you produce to cast a spell on us,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:133" />133: and so We let loose on them the flood, locusts, lice, frogs, blood- all clear signs. They were arrogant, wicked people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:134" />134: They would say, whenever a plague struck them, &lsquo;Moses, pray to your Lord for us by virtue of the promise He has made to you: if you relieve us of the plague, we will believe you and let the Children of Israel go with you,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:135" />135: but when We relieved them of the plague and gave them a fixed period [in which to fulfil their promise]- lo and behold!- they broke it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:136" />136: And so, because they rejected Our signs and paid them no heed, We exacted retribution from them: We drowned them in the sea</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:137" />137: and We made those who had been oppressed succeed to both the east and the west of the land that We had blessed. Your Lord&rsquo;s good promise to the Children of Israel was fulfilled, because of their patience, and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people were making and what they were building.</p>
