<p class="verse"><a name="3:166" />166: what befell you on the day the two armies met in battle happened with God&rsquo;s permission and in order for Him to see who were the true believers and who were the hypocrites who,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:167" />167: when it was said to them, &lsquo;Come, fight for God&rsquo;s cause, or at least defend yourselves,&rsquo; answered, &lsquo;We would follow you if we knew there was going to be fighting.&rsquo; On that day they were closer to disbelief than belief. They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts: God knows exactly what they conceal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:168" />168: As for those who stayed behind, and said of their brothers, &lsquo;If only they had listened to us, they would not have been killed,&rsquo; tell them [Prophet], &lsquo;Ward off death from yourselves, if what you say is true.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:169" />169: [Prophet], do not think of those who have been killed in God&rsquo;s way as dead. They are alive with their Lord, well provided for,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:170" />170: happy with what God has given them of His favour; rejoicing that for those they have left behind who have yet to join them there is no fear, nor will they grieve;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:171" />171: [rejoicing] in God&rsquo;s blessing and favour, and that God will not let the reward of the believers be lost.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:172" />172: Those who responded to God and the Messenger after suffering defeat, who do good and remain conscious of God, will have a great reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:173" />173: Those whose faith only increased when people said, &lsquo;Fear your enemy: they have amassed a great army against you,&rsquo; and who replied, &lsquo;God is enough for us: He is the best protector,&rsquo;</p>
