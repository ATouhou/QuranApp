<p class="verse"><a name="10:62" />62: But for those who are on God&rsquo;s side there is no fear, nor shall they grieve.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:63" />63: For those who believe and are conscious of God,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:64" />64: for them there is good news in this life and in the Hereafter- there is no changing the promises of God- that is truly the supreme triumph.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:65" />65: Do not let their words grieve you [Prophet]. Power belongs entirely to God; He hears all and knows all;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:66" />66: indeed, all who are in the heavens and on the earth belong to Him. Those who call upon others beside God are not really following partner-gods; they are only following assumptions and telling lies.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:67" />67: It is He who made the night so that you can rest in it and the daylight so that you can see- there truly are signs in this for those who hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:68" />68: They say, &lsquo;God has children!&rsquo; May He be exalted! He is the Self-Sufficient One; everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. You have no authority to say this. How dare you say things about God without any knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:69" />69: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;Those who invent lies about God will not prosper.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:70" />70: They may have a little enjoyment in this world, but then they will return to Us. Then We shall make them taste severe punishment for persisting in blasphemy.</p>
