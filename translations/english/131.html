<p class="verse"><a name="6:28" />28: No! The truth they used to hide will become all too clear to them. Even if they were brought back, they would only return to the very thing that was forbidden to them- they are such liars!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:29" />29: They say, &lsquo;There is nothing beyond our life in this world: we shall not be raised from the dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:30" />30: If you could only see, when they are made to stand before their Lord, how He will say, &lsquo;Is this not real?&rsquo; They will say, &lsquo;Yes indeed, by our Lord.&rsquo; He will say, &lsquo;Then taste the torment for having disbelieved.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:31" />31: Lost indeed are those who deny the meeting with their Lord until, when the Hour suddenly arrives, they say, &lsquo;Alas for us that we disregarded this!&rsquo; They will bear their burdens on their backs. How terrible those burdens will be!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:32" />32: The life of this world is nothing but a game and a distraction; the Home in the Hereafter is best for those who are aware of God. Why will you [people] not understand?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:33" />33: We know well that what they say grieves you [Prophet]. It is not you they disbelieve: the evildoers reject God&rsquo;s revelation.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:34" />34: Other messengers were disbelieved before you, and they bore their rejection and persecution steadfastly until Our aid arrived- no one can alter God&rsquo;s promises. You have already received accounts of these messengers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:35" />35: If you find rejection by the disbelievers so hard to bear, then seek a tunnel into the ground or a ladder into the sky, if you can, and bring them a sign: God could bring them all to guidance if it were His will, so do not join the ignorant.</p>
