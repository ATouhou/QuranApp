Anyone who drinks from it will not belong with me, but anyone who refrains from tasting it will belong with me; if he scoops up just one handful [he will be excused].&rsquo; But they all drank [deep] from it, except for a few. When he crossed it with those who had kept faith, they said, &lsquo;We have no strength today against Goliath and his warriors.&rsquo; But those who knew that they were going to meet their Lord said, &lsquo;How often a small force has defeated a large army with God&rsquo;s permission! God is with those who are steadfast.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:250" />250: And when they met Goliath and his warriors, they said, &lsquo;Our Lord, pour patience on us, make us stand firm, and help us against the disbelievers,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:251" />251: and so with God&rsquo;s permission they defeated them. David killed Goliath, and God gave him sovereignty and wisdom and taught him what He pleased. If God did not drive some back by means of others the earth would be completely corrupt, but God is bountiful to all.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:252" />252: These are the revelations of God which We recite to you [Muhammad] with the truth, and you truly are one of the messengers.</p>
