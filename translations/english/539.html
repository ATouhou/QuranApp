<p class="verse"><a name="57:12" />12: On the Day when you [Prophet] see the believers, both men and women, with their light streaming out ahead of them and to their right, [they will be told], &lsquo;The good news for you today is that there are Gardens graced with flowing streams where you will stay: that is truly the supreme triumph!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:13" />13: On the same Day, the hypocrites, both men and women, will say to the believers, &lsquo;Wait for us! Let us have some of your light!&rsquo; They will be told, &lsquo;Go back and look for a light.&rsquo; A wall with a door will be erected between them: inside it lies mercy, outside lies torment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:14" />14: The hypocrites will call out to the believers, &lsquo;Were we not with you?&rsquo; They will reply, &lsquo;Yes. But you allowed yourselves to be tempted, you were hesitant, doubtful, deceived by false hopes until God&rsquo;s command came- the Deceiver tricked you about God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:15" />15: Today no ransom will be accepted from you or from the disbelievers: your home is the Fire- that is where you belong&ndash;&ndash;a miserable destination!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:16" />16: Is it not time for believers to humble their hearts to the remembrance of God and the Truth that has been revealed, and not to be like those who received the Scripture before them, whose time was extended but whose hearts hardened and many of whom were lawbreakers?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:17" />17: Remember that God revives the earth after it dies; We have made Our revelation clear to you so that you may use your reason.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:18" />18: Charitable men and women who make a good loan to God will have it doubled and have a generous reward.</p>
