<p class="verse"><a name="7:52" />52: We have brought people a Scripture- We have explained it on the basis of true knowledge- as guidance and mercy for those who believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:53" />53: What are they waiting for but the fulfilment of its [final prophecy]? On the Day it is fulfilled, those who had ignored it will say, &lsquo;Our Lord&rsquo;s messenger spoke the truth. Is there anyone to intercede for us now? Or can we be sent back to behave differently from the way we behaved before?&rsquo; They will really have squandered their souls, and all [the idols] they invented will have deserted them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:54" />54: Your Lord is God, who created the heavens and earth in six Days, then established Himself on the throne; He makes the night cover the day in swift pursuit; He created the sun, moon, and stars to be subservient to His command; all creation and command belong to Him. Exalted be God, Lord of all the worlds!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:55" />55: Call on your Lord humbly and privately- He does not like those who transgress His bounds:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:56" />56: do not corrupt the earth after it has been set right- call on Him fearing and hoping. The mercy of God is close to those who do good.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:57" />57: It is God who sends the winds, bearing good news of His coming grace, and when they have gathered up the heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land where We cause rain to fall, bringing out all kinds of crops, just as We shall bring out the dead. Will you not reflect?</p>
