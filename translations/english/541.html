<p class="verse"><a name="57:25" />25: We sent Our messengers with clear signs, the Scripture and the Balance, so that people could uphold justice: We also sent iron, with its mighty strength and many uses for mankind, so that God could mark out those who would help Him and His messengers though they cannot see Him. Truly God is powerful, almighty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:26" />26: We sent Noah and Abraham, and gave prophethood and scripture to their offspring: among them there were some who were rightly guided, but many were lawbreakers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:27" />27: We sent other messengers to follow in their footsteps. After those We sent Jesus, son of Mary: We gave him the Gospel and put compassion and mercy into the hearts of his followers. But monasticism was something they invented- We did not ordain it for them- only to seek God&rsquo;s pleasure, and even so, they did not observe it properly. So We gave a reward to those of them who believed, but many of them were lawbreakers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:28" />28: Believers, be mindful of God and have faith in His Messenger: He will give you a double share of His mercy; He will provide a light to help you walk; He will forgive you- God is most forgiving, most merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:29" />29: The People of the Book should know that they have no power over any of God&rsquo;s grace and that grace is in the hand of God alone: He gives it to whoever He will. God&rsquo;s grace is truly immense.</p>
