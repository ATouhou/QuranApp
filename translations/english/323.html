<p class="verse"><a name="21:11" />11: How many communities of evildoers We have destroyed! How many others We have raised up in their places!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:12" />12: When they felt Our might coming upon them, see how they tried to escape it!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:13" />13: &lsquo;Do not try to escape. Go back to your homes and the pleasure you revelled in: you may be questioned.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:14" />14: They said, &lsquo;Woe to us! We were wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:15" />15: and that cry of theirs did not cease until We made them burnt-offstubble.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:16" />16: We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything between them playfully.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:17" />17: If We had wished for a pastime, We could have found it within Us- if We had wished for any such thing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:18" />18: No! We hurl the truth against falsehood, and truth obliterates it- see how falsehood vanishes away! Woe to you [people] for the way you describe God!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:19" />19: Everyone in the heavens and earth belongs to Him, and those that are with Him are never too proud to worship Him, nor do they grow weary;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:20" />20: they glorify Him tirelessly night and day.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:21" />21: Have they chosen any gods from the earth who can give life to the dead?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:22" />22: If there had been in the heavens or earth any gods but Him, both heavens and earth would be in ruins: God, Lord of the Throne, is far above the things they say:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:23" />23: He cannot be called to account for anything He does, whereas they will be called to account.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:24" />24: Have they chosen to worship other gods instead of Him? Say, &lsquo;Bring your proof. This is the Scripture for those who are with me and the Scripture for those who went before me.&rsquo; But most of them do not recognize the truth, so they pay no heed.</p>
