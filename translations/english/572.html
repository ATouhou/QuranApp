<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:1" />1: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;It has been revealed to me that a group of jinn once listened in and said, &ldquo;We have heard a wondrous Quran,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:2" />2: that gives guidance to the right path, and we have come to believe it&ndash;&ndash;We shall never set up partners with our Lord&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:3" />3: and that He&ndash;&ndash;exalted be the glory of our Lord!&ndash;&ndash;has neither spouse nor child.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:4" />4: Outrageous things have been said about God by the foolish among us,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:5" />5: although we had thought that no man or jinn would [dare to] tell a lie about Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:6" />6: Men have sought refuge with the jinn in the past, but they only misguided them further.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:7" />7: They thought, as you did, that God would never raise anyone from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:8" />8: We tried to reach heaven, but discovered it to be full of stern guards and shooting stars&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:9" />9: we used to sit in places there, listening, but anyone trying to listen now will find a shooting star lying in wait for him&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:10" />10: [so now] we do not know whether those who live on earth are due for misfortune, or whether their Lord intends to guide them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:11" />11: Some of us are righteous and others less so: we follow different paths.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:12" />12: We know we can never frustrate God on earth; we can never escape Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="72:13" />13: When we heard the guidance we came to believe: whoever believes in his Lord need fear no loss nor injustice.</p>
