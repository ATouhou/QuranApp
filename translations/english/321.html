<p class="verse"><a name="20:126" />126: God will say, &lsquo;This is how it is: You ignored Our revelations when they came to you, so today you will be ignored.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:127" />127: This is how We reward those who go too far, and who do not believe in their Lord&rsquo;s revelations. The greatest and most enduring punishment is in the Hereafter.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:128" />128: Do they not draw a lesson from the many generations We destroyed before them, through whose dwelling places they now walk? There truly are signs in this for anyone with understanding!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:129" />129: If it were not for a preordained Word from your Lord [Prophet], they would already have been destroyed. Their time has been set,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:130" />130: so [Prophet] be patient with what they say- celebrate the praise of your Lord, before the rising and setting of the sun, celebrate His praise during the night, and at the beginning and end of the day, so that you may find contentment-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:131" />131: and do not gaze longingly at what We have given some of them to enjoy, the finery of this present life: We test them through this, but the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:132" />132: Order your people to pray, and pray steadfastly yourself. We are not asking you to give Us provision;We provide for you, and the rewards of the Hereafter belong to the devout.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="20:134" />134: If We had destroyed them through punishment before this Messenger came, they would have said, &lsquo;Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we could have followed Your revelations before we suffered humiliation and disgrace!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:135" />135: [Prophet], say, &lsquo;We are all waiting, so you carry on waiting: you will come to learn who has followed the even path, and been rightly guided.&rsquo;</p>
