<p class="verse"><a name="10:34" />34: Ask them, &lsquo;Can any of your partner-gods originate creation, then bring it back to life again in the end?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;It is God that originates creation, and then brings it back to life, so how can you be misled?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:35" />35: Say, &lsquo;Can any of your partner-gods show the way to the Truth?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;God shows the way to the Truth.

<p class="verse"><a name="10:36" />36: Most of them follow nothing but assumptions, but assumptions can be of no value at all against the Truth: God is well aware of what they do.</p>
