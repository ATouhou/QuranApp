<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:1" />1: A release by God and His Messenger from the treaty you [believers] made with the idolaters [is announced]&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:2" />2: you [idolaters] may move freely about the land for four months, but you should bear in mind both that you will not escape God, and that God will disgrace those who defy [Him].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:3" />3: On the Day of the Great Pilgrimage [there will be] a proclamation from God and His Messenger to all people: &lsquo;God and His Messenger are released from [treaty] obligations to the idolaters. It will be better for you [idolaters] if you repent; know that you cannot escape God if you turn away.&rsquo; [Prophet], warn those who ignore [God] that they will have a painful punishment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:4" />4: As for those who have honoured the treaty you made with them and who have not supported anyone against you: fulfil your agreement with them to the end of their term. God loves those who are mindful of Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:5" />5: When the [four] forbidden months are over, wherever you encounter the idolaters, kill them, seize them, besiege them, wait for them at every lookout post; but if they turn [to God], maintain the prayer, and pay the prescribed alms, let them go on their way, for God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:6" />6: If any one of the idolaters should seek your protection [Prophet], grant it to him so that he may hear the word of God, then take him to a place safe for him, for they are people with no knowledge [of it].</p>
