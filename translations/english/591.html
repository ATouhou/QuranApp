<p class="verse"><a name="86:1" />1: By the sky and the night-comer&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:2" />2: What will explain to you what the night-comer is?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:3" />3: The piercing star&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:4" />4: there is a watcher over every soul.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:5" />5: Man should reflect on what he was created from.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:6" />6: He is created from spurting fluid,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:7" />7: then he emerges from between the backbone and breastbone:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:8" />8: God is certainly able to bring him back to life.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:9" />9: On the Day when secrets are laid bare</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:10" />10: he will have no power and no one to help him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:11" />11: By the sky and its recurring rain,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:12" />12: by the earth that cracks open!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:13" />13: This is truly a decisive statement;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:14" />14: it is not something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:15" />15: They plot and scheme,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:16" />16: but so do I:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="86:17" />17: [Prophet], let the disbelievers be, let them be for a while.</p>
<p class="surah">Al-Ala</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:1" />1: [Prophet], glorify the name of your Lord the Most High,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:2" />2: who created [all things] in due proportion;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:3" />3: who determined their destinies and guided them;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:4" />4: who brought out the green pasture</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:5" />5: then made it dark debris.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:6" />6: [Prophet], We shall teach you [the Quran] and you will not forget&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:7" />7: unless God wishes; He knows both what is open and what is hidden&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:8" />8: We shall show you the easy way.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:9" />9: So remind, if reminding will help.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:10" />10: Those who stand in awe of God will heed the reminder,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:11" />11: but it will be ignored by the most wicked,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:12" />12: who will enter the Great Fire,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:13" />13: where they will neither die nor live.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:14" />14: Prosperous are those who purify themselves,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:15" />15: remember the name of their Lord, and pray.</p>
