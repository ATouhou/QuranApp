<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:1" />1: Exalted is He who holds all control in His hands; who has power over all things;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:2" />2: who created death and life to test you [people] and reveal which of you does best&ndash;&ndash;He is the Mighty, the Forgiving;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:3" />3: who created the seven heavens, one above the other. You will not see any flaw in what the Lord of Mercy creates. Look again! Can you see any flaw?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:4" />4: Look again! And again! Your sight will turn back to you, weak and defeated.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:5" />5: We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps and made them [missiles] for stoning devils for whom We have also prepared the torment of a blazing fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:6" />6: For those who defy their Lord We have prepared the torment of Hell: an evil destination.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:7" />7: They will hear it drawing in its breath when they are thrown in. It blazes forth,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:8" />8: almost bursting with rage. Its keepers will ask every group that is thrown in, &lsquo;Did no one come to warn you?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:9" />9: They will reply, &lsquo;Yes, a warner did come to us, but we did not believe him. We said, &ldquo;God has revealed nothing: you are greatly misguided&rdquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:10" />10: They will say, &lsquo;If only we had listened, or reasoned, we would not be with the inhabitants of the blazing fire,&rsquo; and</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:11" />11: they will confess their sins. Away with the inhabitants of the blazing fire!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="67:12" />12: But there is forgiveness and a great reward for those who fear their Lord though they cannot see Him.</p>
