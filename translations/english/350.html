<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:1" />1: This is a sura We have sent down and made obligatory: We have sent down clear revelations in it, so that you may take heed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:2" />2: Strike the adulteress and the adulterer one hundred times. Do not let compassion for them keep you from carrying out God&rsquo;s law&ndash;&ndash;if you believe in God and the Last Day&ndash;&ndash;and ensure that a group of believers witnesses the punishment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:3" />3: The adulterer is only [fit] to marry an adulteress or an idolatress, and the adulteress is only [fit] to marry an adulterer or an idolater: such behaviour is forbidden to believers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:4" />4: As for those who accuse chaste women of fornication, and then fail to provide four witnesses, strike them eighty times, and reject their testimony ever afterwards: they are the lawbreakers,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:5" />5: except for those who repent later and make amends&ndash;&ndash;God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:6" />6: As for those who accuse their own wives of adultery, but have no other witnesses, let each one four times call God to witness that he is telling the truth,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:7" />7: and, the fifth time, call God to reject him if he is lying;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:8" />8: punishment shall be averted from his wife if she in turn four times calls God to witness that her husband is lying</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:9" />9: and, the fifth time, calls God to reject her if he is telling the truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:10" />10: If it were not for God&rsquo;s bounty and mercy towards you, if it were not that God accepts repentance and is wise . . .!</p>
