<p class="verse"><a name="6:158" />158: Are they waiting for the very angels to come to them, or your Lord Himself, or maybe some of His signs? But on the Day some of your Lord&rsquo;s signs come, no soul will profit from faith if it had none before, or has not already earned some good through its faith. Say, &lsquo;Wait if you wish: we too are waiting.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:159" />159: As for those who have divided their religion and broken up into factions, have nothing to do with them [Prophet]. Their case rests with God: in time He will tell them about their deeds.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:160" />160: Whoever has done a good deed will have it ten times to his credit, but whoever has done a bad deed will be repaid only with its equivalent- they will not be wronged.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:161" />161: Say, &lsquo;My Lord has guided me to a straight path, an upright religion, the faith of Abraham, a man of pure faith. He was not a polytheist.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:162" />162: Say, &lsquo;My prayers and sacrifice, my life and death, are all for God, Lord of all the Worlds;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:163" />163: He has no partner. This is what I am commanded, and I am the first to devote myself to Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:164" />164: Say, &lsquo;Should I seek a Lord other than God, when He is the Lord of all things?&rsquo; Each soul is responsible for its own actions; no soul will bear the burden of another. You will all return to your Lord in the end, and He will tell you the truth about your differences.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:165" />165: It is He who made you successors on the earth and raises some of you above others in rank, to test you through what He gives you. [Prophet], your Lord is swift in punishment, yet He is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
