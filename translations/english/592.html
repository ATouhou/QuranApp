<p class="verse"><a name="87:16" />16: Yet you [people] prefer the life of this world,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:17" />17: even though the Hereafter is better and more lasting.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:18" />18: All this is in the earlier scriptures,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="87:19" />19: the scriptures of Abraham and Moses.</p>
<p class="surah">Al-Ghashiya</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:1" />1: Have you heard tell [Prophet] about the Overwhelming Event?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:2" />2: On that Day, there will be downcast faces,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:3" />3: toiling and weary,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:4" />4: as they enter the blazing Fire</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:5" />5: and are forced to drink from a boiling spring,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:6" />6: with no food for them except bitter dry thorns</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:7" />7: that neither nourish nor satisfy hunger.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:8" />8: On that Day there will also be faces radiant with bliss,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:9" />9: well pleased with their labour,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:10" />10: in a lofty garden,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:11" />11: where they will hear no idle talk,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:12" />12: with a flowing spring,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:13" />13: raised couches,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:14" />14: goblets placed before them,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:15" />15: cushions set in rows,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:16" />16: and carpets spread.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:17" />17: Do the disbelievers not see how rain clouds are formed,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:18" />18: how the heavens are lifted,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:19" />19: how the mountains are raised high,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:20" />20: how the earth is spread out?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:21" />21: So [Prophet] warn them: your only task is to give warning,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:22" />22: you are not there to control them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:23" />23: As for those who turn away and disbelieve,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:24" />24: God will inflict the greatest torment upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:25" />25: It is to Us they will return,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="88:26" />26: and then it is for Us to call them to account.</p>
