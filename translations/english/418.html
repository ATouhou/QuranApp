<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:1" />1: Prophet, be mindful of God and do not give in to the disbelievers and the hypocrites: God is all knowing, all wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:2" />2: Follow what your Lord reveals to you: God is well aware of all your actions.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:3" />3: Put your trust in God: God is enough to trust.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:4" />4: God does not put two hearts within a man&rsquo;s breast. He does not turn the wives you reject and liken to your mothers&rsquo; backs into your real mothers; nor does He make your adopted sons into real sons. These are only words from your mouths, while God speaks the truth and guides people to the right path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:5" />5: Name your adopted sons after their real fathers: this is more equitable in God&rsquo;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;if you do not know who their fathers are [they are your] &lsquo;brothers-in-religion&rsquo; and proteges. You will not be blamed if you make a mistake, only for what your hearts deliberately intend; God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:6" />6: The Prophet is more protective towards the believers than they are themselves, while his wives are their mothers. In God&rsquo;s Scripture, blood-relatives have a stronger claim than other believers and emigrants, though you may still bestow gifts on your proteges. All this is written in the Scripture.</p>
