<p class="verse"><a name="5:77" />77: Say, &lsquo;People of the Book, do not overstep the bounds of truth in your religion and do not follow the whims of those who went astray before you- they led many others astray and themselves continue to stray from the even path.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:78" />78: Those Children of Israel who defied [God] were rejected through the words of David, and Jesus, son of Mary, because they disobeyed, they persistently overstepped the limits,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:79" />79: they did not forbid each other to do wrong. How vile their deeds were!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:80" />80: You [Prophet] see many of them allying themselves with the disbelievers. How terrible is what their souls have stored up for them: God is angry with them and they will remain tormented.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:81" />81: If they had believed in God, in the Prophet, and in what was sent down to him, they would never have allied themselves with the disbelievers, but most of them are rebels.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:82" />82: You [Prophet] are sure to find that the most hostile to the believers are the Jews and those who associate other deities with God; you are sure to find that the closest in affection towards the believers are those who say, &lsquo;We are Christians,&rsquo; for there are among them people devoted to learning and ascetics. These people are not given to arrogance,</p>
