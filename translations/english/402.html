<p class="verse"><a name="29:46" />46: [Believers], argue only in the best way with the People of the Book, except with those of them who act unjustly. Say, &lsquo;We believe in what was revealed to us and in what was revealed to you; our God and your God are one [and the same]; we are devoted to Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="29:47" />47: This is the way We sent the Scripture to you [Muhammad]. Those to whom We had already given Scripture believe in [the Quran] and so do some of these people. No one refuses to acknowledge Our revelations but the defiant.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="29:48" />48: You never recited any Scripture before We revealed this one to you; you never wrote one down with your hand. If you had done so, those who follow falsehood might have had cause to doubt.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="29:49" />49: But no, [this Quran] is a revelation that is clear to the hearts of those endowed with knowledge. No one refuses to acknowledge Our revelations but the evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="29:50" />50: They say, &lsquo;Why have no miracles been sent to him by his Lord?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Miracles lie in God&rsquo;s hands; I am simply here to warn you plainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="29:51" />51: Do they not think it is enough that We have sent down to you the Scripture that is recited to them? There is a mercy in this and a lesson for believing people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="29:52" />52: Say, &lsquo;God is sufficient witness between me and you: He knows what is in the heavens and earth. Those who believe in false deities and deny God will be the losers.&rsquo;</p>
