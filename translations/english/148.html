<p class="verse"><a name="6:147" />147: If they [the disbelievers] accuse you [Prophet] of lying, say, &lsquo;Your Lord has all-encompassing mercy, but His punishment cannot be diverted from the evildoers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:148" />148: The idolaters will say, &lsquo;If God had willed, we would not have ascribed partners to Him- nor would our fathers- or have declared anything forbidden.&rsquo; In the same way, those before them continually denied [the truth] until they tasted Our punishment. Say, &lsquo;Have you any knowledge that you can show us? You follow only supposition and tell only lies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:149" />149: Say, &lsquo;The conclusive argument belongs to God alone. Had He so willed He would have guided you all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:150" />150: Say, &lsquo;Bring your witnesses to testify that God has forbidden all this.&rsquo; If they do testify, do not bear witness with them. Do not follow the whims of those who have denied Our revelation, who do not believe in the Hereafter, and who set up equals with their Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:151" />151: Say, &lsquo;Come! I will tell you what your Lord has really forbidden you. Do not ascribe anything as a partner to Him; be good to your parents; do not kill your children in fear of poverty&rsquo;- We will provide for you and for them- &lsquo; stay well away from committing obscenities, whether openly or in secret; do not take the life God has made sacred, except by right. This is what He commands you to do: perhaps you will use your reason.</p>
