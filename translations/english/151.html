<p class="verse"><a name="7:1" />1: Alif Lam Mim Sad</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:2" />2: This Book has been sent down to you [Prophet]&ndash;&ndash;let there be no anxiety in your heart because of it&ndash;&ndash;so that you may use it to give warning and to remind the believers:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:3" />3: &lsquo;Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord; do not follow other masters beside Him. How seldom you take heed!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:4" />4: How many towns We have destroyed! Our punishment came to them by night or while they slept in the afternoon:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:5" />5: their only cry when Our punishment came to them was, &lsquo;How wrong we were!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:6" />6: We shall certainly question those to whom messengers were sent&ndash;&ndash; and We shall question the messengers themselves&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:7" />7: and, with full knowledge, for We were never far from them, We shall tell them what they did.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:8" />8: On that Day the weighing of deeds will be true and just: those whose good deeds are heavy on the scales will be the ones to prosper,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:9" />9: and those whose good deeds are light will be the ones who have lost their souls through their wrongful rejection of Our messages.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:10" />10: We established you [people] on the earth and provided you with a means of livelihood there&ndash;&ndash;small thanks you give!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:11" />11: We created you, We gave you shape, and then We said to the angels, &lsquo;Bow down before Adam,&rsquo; and they did. But not Iblis: he was not one of those who bowed down.</p>
