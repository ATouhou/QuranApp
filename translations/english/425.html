<p class="verse"><a name="33:51" />51: You may make any of [your women] wait and receive any of them as you wish, but you will not be at fault if you invite one whose turn you have previously set aside: this way it is more likely that they will be satisfied and will not be distressed and will all be content with what you have given them. God knows what is in your hearts: God is all knowing, forbearing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:52" />52: You [Prophet] are not permitted to take any further wives, nor to exchange the wives you have for others, even if these attract you with their beauty. But this does not apply to your slave-girls: God is watchful over all.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:53" />53: Believers, do not enter the Prophet&rsquo;s apartments for a meal unless you are given permission to do so; do not linger until [a meal] is ready. When you are invited, go in; then, when you have taken your meal, leave. Do not stay on and talk, for that would offend the Prophet, though he would shrink from asking you to leave. God does not shrink from the truth. When you ask his wives for something, do so from behind a screen: this is purer both for your hearts and for theirs. It is not right for you to offend God&rsquo;s Messenger, just as you should never marry his wives after him: that would be grievous in God&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:54" />54: God has full knowledge of all things, whether you reveal them or not.</p>
