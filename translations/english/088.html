<p class="verse"><a name="4:60" />60: Do you [Prophet] not see those who claim to believe in what has been sent down to you, and in what was sent down before you, yet still want to turn to unjust tyrants for judgement, although they have been ordered to reject them? Satan wants to lead them far astray.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:61" />61: When they are told, &lsquo;Turn to God&rsquo;s revelations and the Messenger [for judgement],&rsquo; you see the hypocrites turn right away from you [Prophet].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:62" />62: If disaster strikes them because of what they themselves have done, then they will come to you, swearing by God, &lsquo;We only wanted to do good and achieve harmony.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:63" />63: God knows well what is in the hearts of these people, so ignore what they say, instruct them, and speak to them about themselves using penetrating words.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:64" />64: All the messengers We sent were meant to be obeyed, by God&rsquo;s leave. If only [the hypocrites] had come to you [Prophet] when they wronged themselves, and begged God&rsquo;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found that God accepts repentance and is most merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:65" />65: By your Lord, they will not be true believers until they let you decide between them in all matters of dispute, and find no resistance in their souls to your decisions, accepting them totally-</p>
