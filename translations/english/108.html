<p class="verse"><a name="5:6" />6: You who believe, when you are about to pray, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, wipe your heads, wash your feet up to the ankles and, if required, wash your whole body. If any of you is sick or on a journey, or has just relieved himself, or had intimate contact with a woman, and can find no water, then take some clean sand and wipe your face and hands with it. God does not wish to place any burden on you: He only wishes to cleanse you and perfect His blessing on you, so that you may be thankful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:7" />7: Remember God&rsquo;s blessing on you and the pledge with which you were bound when you said, &lsquo;We hear and we obey.&rsquo; Be mindful of God: God has full knowledge of the secrets of the heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:8" />8: You who believe, be steadfast in your devotion to God and bear witness impartially: do not let hatred of others lead you away from justice, but adhere to justice, for that is closer to awareness of God. Be mindful of God: God is well aware of all that you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:9" />9: God has promised forgiveness and a rich reward to those who have faith and do good works;</p>
