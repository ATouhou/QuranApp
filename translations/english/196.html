<p class="verse"><a name="9:55" />55: So [Prophet] do not let their possessions or their children impress you: through these God intends to punish them in this world and for their souls to depart while they disbelieve.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:56" />56: They swear by God that they belong with you [believers], but they do not. They are cowardly:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:57" />57: if they could find a place of refuge, or a cave, or somewhere to crawl into, they would run there with great haste.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:58" />58: Some of them find fault with you [Prophet] regarding the distribution of alms: they are content if they are given a share, but angry if not.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:59" />59: If only they would be content with what God and His Messenger have given them, and say, &lsquo;God is enough for us- He will give us some of His bounty and so will His Messenger- to God alone we turn in hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:60" />60: Alms are meant only for the poor, the needy, those who administer them, those whose hearts need winning over, to free slaves and help those in debt, for God&rsquo;s cause, and for travellers in need. This is ordained by God; God is all knowing and wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:61" />61: There are others who insult the Prophet by saying, &lsquo;He will listen to anything.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;He listens for your own good: he believes in God, trusts the believers, and is a mercy for those of you who believe.&rsquo; An agonizing torment awaits those who insult God&rsquo;s Messenger.</p>
