<p class="verse"><a name="27:36" />36: When her envoy came to Solomon, Solomon said, &lsquo;What! Are you offering me wealth? What God has given me is better than what He has given you, though you rejoice in this gift of yours.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:37" />37: Go back to your people: we shall certainly come upon them with irresistible forces, and drive them, disgraced and humbled, from their land.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:38" />38: Then he said, &lsquo;Counsellors, which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:39" />39: A powerful and crafty jinn replied, &lsquo;I will bring it to you before you can even rise from your place. I am strong and trustworthy enough,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:40" />40: but one of them who had some knowledge of the Scripture said, &lsquo;I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye.&rsquo; When Solomon saw it set before him, he said, &lsquo;This is a favour from my Lord, to test whether I am grateful or not: if anyone is grateful, it is for his own good, if anyone is ungrateful, then my Lord is self-sufficient and most generous.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:41" />41: Then he said, &lsquo;Disguise her throne, and we shall see whether or not she recognizes it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:42" />42: When she arrived, she was asked, &lsquo;Is this your throne?&rsquo; She replied, &lsquo;It looks like it.&rsquo; [Solomon said], &lsquo;We were given knowledge before her, and we devoted ourselves to God;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:43" />43: she was prevented by what she worshipped instead of God, for she came from a disbelieving people.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="27:44" />44: Then it was said to her, &lsquo;Enter the hall,&rsquo; but when she saw it, she thought it was a deep pool of water, and bared her legs. Solomon explained, &lsquo;It is just a hall paved with glass,&rsquo; and she said, &lsquo;My Lord, I have wronged myself: I devote myself, with Solomon, to God, the Lord of the Worlds.&rsquo;</p>
