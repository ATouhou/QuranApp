<p class="verse"><a name="14:19" />19: [Prophet], do you not see that God created the heavens and the earth for a purpose? He could remove all of you and replace you with a new creation if He wished to:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="14:20" />20: that is not difficult for God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="14:21" />21: When they all appear before Him, the weak will say to the powerseekers, &lsquo;We were your followers. Can you protect us from any of God&rsquo;s punishment?&rsquo; They will reply, &lsquo;If God had guided us, we would have guided you. It makes no difference now whether we rage or endure with patience: there is no escape.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="14:22" />22: When everything has been decided, Satan will say, &lsquo;God gave you a true promise. I too made promises but they were false ones: I had no power over you except to call you, and you responded to my call, so do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I reject the way you associated me with God before.&rsquo; A bitter torment awaits such wrongdoers,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="14:23" />23: but those who believed and did good deeds will be brought into Gardens graced with flowing streams, there to remain with their Lord&rsquo;s permission: their greeting there is &lsquo;Peace&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="14:24" />24: [Prophet], do you not see how God makes comparisons? A good word is like a good tree whose root is firm and whose branches are high in the sky,</p>
