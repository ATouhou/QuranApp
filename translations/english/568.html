<p class="verse"><a name="69:40" />40: this [Quran] is the speech of an honoured messenger,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:41" />41: not the words of a poet- how little you believe!-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:42" />42: nor the words of a soothsayer- how little you reflect!</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="69:45" />45: We would certainly have seized his right hand</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:46" />46: and cut off his lifeblood,</p>
