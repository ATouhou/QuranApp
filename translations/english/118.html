<p class="verse"><a name="5:58" />58: When you make the call to prayer, they ridicule it and make fun of it: this is because they are people who do not reason.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:59" />59: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;People of the Book, do you resent us for any reason other than the fact that we believe in God, in what has been sent down to us, and in what was sent before us, while most of you are disobedient?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:60" />60: Say, &lsquo;Shall I tell you who deserves a worse punishment from God than [the one you wish upon] us? Those God distanced from Himself, was angry with, and condemned as apes and pigs, and those who worship idols: they are worse in rank and have strayed further from the right path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:61" />61: When they come to you [believers], they say, &lsquo;We believe,&rsquo; but they come disbelieving and leave disbelieving- God knows best what they are hiding.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:62" />62: You [Prophet] see many of them rushing into sin and hostility and consuming what is unlawful. How evil their practices are!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:63" />63: Why do their rabbis and scholars not forbid them to speak sinfully and consume what is unlawful? How evil their deeds are!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:64" />64: The Jews have said, &lsquo;God is tight-fisted,&rsquo; but it is they who are tight-fisted, and they are rejected for what they have said. Truly, God&rsquo;s hands are open wide: He gives as He pleases. What has been sent down to you from your Lord is sure to increase insolence and defiance in many of them. We have sown enmity and hatred amongst them till the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, God will put it out. They try to spread corruption in the land, but God does not love those who corrupt.</p>
