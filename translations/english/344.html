<p class="verse"><a name="23:28" />28: and when you and your companions are settled on the Ark, say, &ldquo;Praise be to God, who delivered us from the wicked people,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:29" />29: and say, &ldquo;My Lord, let me land with Your blessing: it is You who provide the best landings&rdquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:30" />30: There are signs in all this: We have always put [people] to the test.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:31" />31: Then We raised another generation after them,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:32" />32: and sent one of their own as a messenger: &lsquo;Serve God, for He is your only god. Will you not heed Him?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:33" />33: But the leading disbelievers among his people, who denied the Meeting in the Hereafter, to whom We had granted ease and plenty in this life, said, &lsquo;He is just a mortal like you- he eats what you eat and drinks what you drink-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:34" />34: and you will really be losers if you obey a mortal like yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:35" />35: How can he promise you that after you die and become dust and bones you will be brought out alive?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:36" />36: What you are promised is very farfetched.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:37" />37: There is only the life of this world: we die, we live, but we will never be resurrected.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:38" />38: He is just a man making lies up about God. We will never believe in him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:39" />39: The prophet said, &lsquo;My Lord, help me! They call me a liar,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:40" />40: and so God said, &lsquo;Soon they will be filled with regret.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:41" />41: The blast justly struck them and We swept them away like scum. Away with the evildoers!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:42" />42: We raised other generations after them-</p>
